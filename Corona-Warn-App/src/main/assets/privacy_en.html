</p>
<h1>
    1. Who is the Corona-Warn-App published by?
</h1>
<p>
    This app is published by the Robert Koch Institute (<strong>RKI</strong>)
    for the German Federal Government. The RKI is also responsible for ensuring
    that your data is processed in accordance with data protection regulations.
</p>
<p>
    If you are infected and voluntarily use the transnational warning feature,
    it is also possible to warn users of the official coronavirus apps of other
    participating countries with whom you have been in contact. In this case,
    the RKI and the competent health authorities of the countries participating
    in the transnational warning system are so-called joint controllers,
    meaning they are jointly responsible for data processing. Please refer to
    Section 7 for more details.
</p>
<h1>
    2. Is using the app voluntary?
</h1>
<p>
    Using the app is voluntary. It is entirely up to you whether you install
    the app, which of the app’s features you use, and whether you share data
    with others. All of the app’s features that require data transfer will
    obtain your express consent in advance. If you do not give your consent or
    if you subsequently withdraw it, this will not result in any disadvantages
    for you.
</p>
<h1>

    3. On what legal basis is your data processed?
</h1>
<p>
    Your data will only be processed on the basis of your explicit consent. The
    legal basis is Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(a) GDPR and, in the case of health
    data, Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR. After granting your consent, you can withdraw it
    at any time. Please refer to Section 12 for further information about your
    right of withdrawal.
</p>
<h1>
    4. Who is the app aimed at?
</h1>
<p>
    The app is aimed at people who are resident in Germany and at least 16
    years old.
</p>
<h1>
    5. What data is processed?
</h1>
<p>
    The app has been programmed to process as little personal data as possible.
    This means that the app does not collect any data that would allow the RKI
    or other users to infer your identity, your name, your location or other
    personal details. The app does not therefore use any analysis tools to
    evaluate the way you use it.
</p>
<p>
    The data processed by the app can be grouped into the following categories:
</p>
<h2>
    a. Access data
</h2>
<p>
    Every time the app exchanges data over the internet with the RKI’s server
    system (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>server system</strong>), the
    server system processes so-called access data. This is necessary so that
    the app can retrieve current data (e.g. for warnings) or transmit certain
    data stored on your smartphone to the server system. This access data
    includes the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        IP address
    </li>
    <li>
        Date and time of retrieval
    </li>
    <li>
        Transmitted data volume (or packet length)
    </li>
    <li>
        Notification of whether the data exchange was a success.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This access data is processed to maintain and secure the technical
    operation of the app and the server system. You are not identified
    personally as a user of the app and no user profile will be created. Your
    IP address will not be stored beyond the end of the usage procedure.
</p>
<p>
    In order to prevent unauthorised parties from using your IP address to
    associate your data with you when you use the app, the app only ever
    accesses the server system via a special access server. This access server
    then forwards the data requested or transmitted by the app to the
    appropriate server, but without your IP address, meaning that your IP
    address is no longer processed within the server system.
</p>
<h2>
    b. Exposure data
</h2>
<p>
    As soon as you enable your iPhone’s or your Android smartphone’s COVID-19
    Exposure Notification System (which is called “Exposure Notification” or
    “COVID-19 Exposure Notifications” respectively), your smartphone transmits
    so-called exposure data via Bluetooth, which other smartphones in your
    vicinity can record. Your smartphone, in turn, also receives the exposure
    data of other smartphones. The exposure data transmitted by your smartphone
    comprises:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Random identification numbers (hereinafter referred to as <strong>random IDs</strong>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Bluetooth protocol version
    </li>
    <li>
        Bluetooth transmit power in decibel-milliwatts (dBm).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If exposure to another smartphone is recorded, the exposure data also
    includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Day, time and duration of the contact
    </li>
    <li>
        Bluetooth signal strength in dBm.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The random IDs are changed regularly. This helps prevent your smartphone
    from being identified using these random IDs. The exposure data transmitted
    by your smartphone and the exposure data recorded when you come into
    contact with other app users are stored on your smartphone and deleted
    after 14 days. The exposure data transmitted by your smartphone is
    processed in the same way when it is recorded by the smartphones of other
    app users.
</p>
<p>
    Please note: the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System functionality is
    part of your operating system. The providers responsible for this system
    are therefore Apple (if you have an iPhone) and Google (if you have an
    Android smartphone). In this respect, the data processing is subject to
    these companies’ own privacy policies, which means that the RKI is not
    responsible for this and has no influence on it. Depending on the version
    and configuration of your operating system, the actual names, operating
    steps and settings options may differ from those described in this privacy
    notice. More information is available from the respective providers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you have an Android smartphone, you can find information from Google
        on your device by going to “Settings” &gt; “Google” &gt; “COVID-19
        exposure notifications” and tapping on “Learn more”.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have an iPhone, you can find information from Apple on your
        device by going to “Settings” &gt; “Exposure Notification” and tapping
        on “How Exposure Notification works ...”.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    c. Health data
</h2>
<p>
    Health data is any data containing information about a person’s health.
    This includes not only information about past and current illnesses, but
    also about a person’s risk of illness (such as the risk that a person has
    been infected with coronavirus). The app processes health data in the
    following cases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        When a possible exposure is identified
    </li>
    <li>
        If you register a test or a positive test result
    </li>
    <li>
        If you retrieve a positive test result in the app
    </li>
    <li>
        If you use the app to warn other users that they may be infected
    </li>
    <li>
        If you provide information about the onset of any coronavirus symptoms.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Section 6 explains this in more detail.
</p>
<h1>
    6. Why is your data processed?
</h1>
<h2>
    a. Risk identification
</h2>
<p>
    Risk identification is part of the app’s main functionality. It serves to
    warn you of possible contacts with persons who have tested positive for
    coronavirus (“possible exposures”) in a number of different countries, to
    assess the risk that you yourself have been infected as a result of one of
    those contacts, and to provide you with appropriate health advice and
    recommendations for what to do next.
</p>
<p>
    For this purpose, the app runs in the background and retrieves an
    up-to-date list every day of random IDs, and possible information about the
    onset of symptoms, from the server system. This list contains the random
    IDs and possible symptom information of users who have tested positive for
    coronavirus and voluntarily used the warning feature in their app, which is
    the official coronavirus app in any country participating in the
    transnational warning system (see Section 7) (hereinafter referred to as a <strong>positive
    list</strong>). The random IDs in the positive list also
    contain a transmission risk value and an indication of the type of
    diagnosis (see Section 6 c.).
</p>
<p>
    The app passes the random IDs to the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System,
    which compares them with the random IDs it has recorded. If the COVID-19
    Exposure Notification System detects a match, it transfers to the app the
    exposure data recorded for the possible exposure in question. The app
    evaluates this data as well as the information in the positive list
    (transmission risk value; information about the onset of symptoms) in order
    to determine your risk of infection. The evaluation algorithm which
    determines how this information is evaluated (for example, how the duration
    of a contact influences the risk of infection) is based on the RKI’s latest
    scientific findings. In the event of new findings, the RKI can update the
    evaluation algorithm by adjusting the evaluation settings in the app. In
    this case, the new evaluation settings are sent to the app together with
    the positive list.
</p>
<p>
    The risk of infection is calculated exclusively within the app and is not
    passed on to the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System or any other
    recipient (including the RKI, other health authorities in Germany or other
    countries, Apple, Google and other third parties).
</p>
<h2>
    b. Registering a test
</h2>
<p>
    If you have been tested for coronavirus, you can register your test in the
    app. The app will then notify you as soon as the test result is available.
    For this to work, the testing laboratory needs to be connected to the
    server system and, as part of the testing procedure, you must have agreed
    separately to the laboratory transmitting your test result to the server
    system (test result database). It is not possible to display test results
    from laboratories that are not connected to the server system. If you have
    not received a QR code, then you cannot use this feature.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Registering a test</u>
</p>
<p>
    To be able to retrieve your test result in the app, you must first register
    your test. Your doctor or the testing facility will provide you with a QR
    code for this purpose. This QR code contains a code number which the app
    can read. To register your test, you will need to scan the QR code in the
    app using your smartphone’s camera. After reading the code number, the app
    ‘hashes’ it. This means that the app performs a certain mathematical
    procedure in order to convert the code number in such a way that it can no
    longer be identified. As soon as your smartphone is connected to the
    internet, the app will transmit the hashed code number to the server
    system. In return, the app receives a token from the server system, i.e. a
    digital access key that is stored in the app. The token is linked to the
    hashed code number in the server system. The app then deletes the hashed
    code number on your smartphone. This completes the registration of your
    test. The server system will only issue a token once for each hashed code
    number. This ensures that your QR code cannot be used by other users of the
    app to retrieve test results.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Filing of the test result</u>
</p>
<p>
    As soon as the testing laboratory receives the test result, it stores the
    result in the RKI’s test result database, indicating the hashed code
    number. The test result database is located on a special server within the
    server system. Based on the code number contained in the QR code issued to
    you, the testing laboratory also generates the hashed code number using the
    same mathematical procedure as the app.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Retrieval of the test result</u>
</p>
<p>
    Using the token, the app regularly requests the status of the registered
    test from the server system. The server system then assigns the token to
    the hashed code number and transfers it to the test result database. This
    checks whether a test result has now been stored for the hashed code number
    and returns the result. The server system then forwards the status and the
    test result requested from the test database (i.e. whether your result is
    positive or negative) to the app. If you have enabled the test status
    notification in the app (under “Settings” &gt; “Notifications”), you will
    be notified accordingly. The test result will be displayed when you open
    the app.
</p>
<p>
    If you have tested positive for coronavirus, the app uses the token again
    to request a TAN (transaction number) from the server system. The TAN is
    required to ensure that no false warnings are transmitted to other users if
    you subsequently activate the app’s warning feature. To this end, the
    server system reassigns the token to the hashed code number and requests
    confirmation from the test result database that a positive test result
    really does exist for that hashed code number. If this is confirmed, the
    server system generates the TAN and transmits it to the app. A copy of the
    TAN remains on the server system.
</p>
<h2>
    c. Warning others
</h2>
<p>
    If you have tested positive for coronavirus, you can use the transnational
    warning feature to warn other people who use this app or any other official
    coronavirus app in participating countries. In this case, the app transmits
    the following data to the server system:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Your own random IDs from the last 14 days
    </li>
    <li>
        Any information about the onset of symptoms
    </li>
    <li>
        Your TAN (see Section 6 b.).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Your smartphone may first ask you for permission to pass your own random
    IDs from the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System to the app.
</p>
<p>
    Before transmitting the random IDs to the server system, the app adds a
    transmission risk value and a specification of the type of diagnosis to
    each of the random IDs (see also Section 6 a.). Since the app’s warning
    feature can only be used for lab-confirmed diagnoses, the type of diagnosis
    is the same for all users. The transmission risk value is an estimate of
    how infectious you were on the day on which the respective random ID was
    used. Since how infectious a person is or was depends on the duration and
    course of the infection, it can be taken into account, for example, that
    the more time has passed since the onset of symptoms, the lower the risk of
    a person spreading the virus on the day of a possible exposure.
</p>
<p>
    The requested information about the onset of symptoms is optional. However,
    this information may help to calculate the transmission risk value more
    accurately. If you do not provide information about your symptoms, then the
    transmission risk values will be calculated assuming a typical case of
    infection with coronavirus, i.e. the more time has passed since a random ID
    was used, the lower the associated transmission risk value.
</p>
<p>
    <u>If you have not retrieved your test result in the app:</u>
</p>
<p>
    Even if you have not retrieved your positive test result via the app, you
    can still warn your fellow human beings. To do this, select the “Request
    TAN” procedure. The app will then prompt you to call the app hotline. A
    hotline worker will then ask you a few questions to make sure that you
    really have tested positive for coronavirus. This is to prevent false
    warnings being transmitted, either by accident or intentionally. Once you
    have answered these questions sufficiently, you will be asked for your
    mobile/telephone number and your name. This is so that you can be called
    back later and given what’s called a TeleTAN to enter in the app. Your
    mobile/telephone number and your name will be temporarily stored for this
    purpose only and deleted after an hour at the latest. Immediately after
    your call, the hotline worker will generate your TeleTAN via a special
    access to the server system and then call you back to tell you your
    TeleTAN. A TeleTAN is only valid for one hour and will therefore be deleted
    no later than one hour after it has been passed on to you. After a valid
    TeleTAN is entered in the app, it is transmitted to the server system for
    verification. Upon successful verification, the app receives a token from
    the server system, i.e. a digital access key that is stored in the app.
    Using this token, the app then requests a TAN from the server system.
</p>
<h2>
    d. Using the app for information purposes only
</h2>
<p>
    As long as you use the app for information purposes only, i.e. do not use
    any of the features mentioned above, then processing only takes place
    locally on your smartphone and the RKI will not process any personal data.
    Websites linked in the app, such as www.bundesregierung.de, are
    opened and displayed in your smartphone’s standard browser (Android
    smartphones) or within the app (iPhones). The data processed here is
    determined by the respective providers of the websites accessed.
</p>
<h1>7. How does the transnational warning system work?

</h1>
<p>
    To ensure that users are also warned by the official coronavirus apps of
    other countries, the RKI, together with several official healthcare bodies
    and authorities in other countries (hereinafter referred to as <strong>health
    authorities</strong>) has set up a central warning server
    for sharing warnings between countries (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>exchange
    server</strong>). The exchange server uses the digital
    infrastructure of the eHealth Network established between the Member
    States.
</p>
<p>
    The national server systems of the coronavirus apps connected to the
    exchange server regularly transmit their own positive lists to the exchange
    server and receive the positive lists of the other countries.
</p>
<p>
    The server system merges the positive lists received in this way with its
    own positive list, which allows the risk identification feature to also
    take into account possible exposures involving users of another coronavirus
    app (see point 6 c.) The other participating countries proceed in the same
    way with the positive lists provided by the RKI.
</p>
<p>
    Only countries whose coronavirus apps are compatible with each other and
    which guarantee a comparably high level of data protection can participate
    in the joint exchange server. In particular, this requires that the
    coronavirus apps of the participating countries also use the COVID-19
    Exposure Notification System, are approved by the respective national
    health authorities, and respect the privacy of their users. The technical
    and organisational details of this cooperation are laid down in an EU
    Commission Decision (Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/1023 of 15
    July 2020, which is available at
    https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2020/1023/oj ).
</p>
<p>
    Together with the respective competent health authorities of the
    participating countries, the RKI is a joint controller under data
    protection law, meaning it is responsible for processing the information
    contained in the positive lists (random IDs and, if applicable, information
    about the onset of symptoms) on the exchange server in order to enable the
    transnational risk identification and warning system.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the list of participating countries is subject to change.
    The current list, with details of the competent health authorities in each
    case, can be found in the FAQs available at
    https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/#interoperability_countries .
</p>
<h1>
    8. What permissions does the app require?
</h1>
<p>
    The app requires access to a number of your smartphone’s features and
    interfaces. For this purpose, you need to grant the app certain
    permissions. The permission system depends on your operating system’s
    specifications. For example, your smartphone may combine individual
    permissions into permission categories, where you can only agree to the
    permission category as a whole. Please note that without the permissions
    requested by the app, you will not be able to use some or all of the app
    features.
</p>
<h2>
    a. Technical requirements (all smartphones)
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The app requires an internet connection in order to exchange data with
        the server system.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Bluetooth feature must be enabled so that your smartphone can
        transmit its own random IDs and record the random IDs of other
        smartphones.
    </li>
    <li>
        The app needs to be able to run in the background on your smartphone in
        order to automatically identify your risk of infection and check the
        status of a registered test. If you deny the app permission to run in
        the background, then you must start all actions in the app itself.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    b. Android smartphones
</h2>
<p>
    If you are using an Android smartphone, the following system features must
    also be enabled:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Android COVID-19 exposure notification system (COVID-19 Exposure
        Notifications)
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have a smartphone running on Android version 10 or lower,
        location services need to be enabled for your smartphone to search for
        Bluetooth signals from other smartphones. Please note that no location
        data is collected in this process.
    </li>
    <li>
        To be notified of changes in your risk of infection and the status of
        test results, the notification feature must be enabled. The
        notification feature is enabled by default in the operating system.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The app also requires the following permissions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The feature for registering your test requires access to the camera in
        order to read the QR code.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    c. iPhones (Apple iOS)
</h2>
<p>
    If you are using an iPhone, the following system features must be enabled:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The iOS COVID-19 exposure notification system (Exposure Notification)
    </li>
    <li>
        Notifications must be enabled so that you can be notified of changes in
        your risk of infection and the status of test results.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The app also requires the following permissions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The feature for registering your test requires access to the camera in
        order to read the QR code.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>
    9. When will your data be deleted?
</h1>
<p>
    The storage period depends on the purposes or app features for which your
    data has been stored. When determining the storage period, the RKI takes
    into account the latest scientific findings on the incubation period (up to
    14 days) as well as on how long there is a risk of an infected person
    infecting someone else after the end of the incubation period. Unless
    otherwise specified under Section 6, the following storage periods apply:
</p>
<h2>
    a. Data on your smartphone
</h2>
<p>
    The retrieved positive lists are deleted from the app memory after 14 days.
    The infection risk determined in the app (e.g. “low risk”) is deleted from
    the app memory after each update, but after 14 days at the latest. If you
    have registered a positive coronavirus test, the token in the app memory is
    deleted as soon as you activate the warning feature.
</p>
<h2>
    b. Data on server systems
</h2>
<p>
    Positive lists are deleted from all server systems (including exchange
    servers) after 14 days. All other data will be deleted after 21 days at the
    latest.
</p>
<h1>
    10. Who will receive your data?
</h1>
<p>
    If you warn other users via the app, your random IDs from the last 14 days
    as well as optional information you provide about the onset of your
    symptoms will be forwarded to the competent health authorities of each of
    the countries participating in the exchange server. From there, they will
    be passed on to the server systems of the coronavirus apps of those
    countries participating in the transnational warning system. The server
    systems of the national coronavirus apps then distribute your data to their
    own users as part of the positive lists.
</p>
<p>
    The competent national health authorities in the participating countries
    have commissioned the EU Commission, as data processor, to operate and
    maintain the joint warning system.
</p>
<p>
    The RKI has commissioned T-Systems International GmbH and SAP Deutschland
    SE &amp; Co. KG to operate and maintain part of the technical
    infrastructure of the app (e.g. server system, hotline), meaning that these
    two companies are processors under data protection law and acting on the
    RKI’s behalf. The EU Commission has also commissioned these companies, as
    sub-processors, with the technical provision and management of the
    participating countries’ joint warning system.
</p>
<p>
    Otherwise, the RKI will only pass on your data collected in connection with
    your use of the app to third parties if the RKI is legally obliged to do so
    or if this is necessary for legal action or criminal prosecution in the
    case of attacks on the app’s technical infrastructure. In other cases,
    personal data will not generally be passed on.
</p>
<h1>
    11. Is your data transferred to countries outside the EU?
</h1>
<p>
    If you activate the app’s warning feature, the coronavirus apps connected
    to the shared exchange server can retrieve the current positive lists
    worldwide, which means that users who are currently abroad on holiday or
    business trips, for example, can also be warned. Otherwise, the data
    transmitted by the app is processed exclusively on servers in Germany or in
    another country in the EU (or the European Economic Area), which are
    therefore subject to the strict requirements of the General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR).
</p>
<h1>
    12. How can you withdraw your consent?
</h1>
<p>
    You have the right to withdraw any consent you granted the RKI in the app
    at any time with effect for the future. Please note that this will not
    affect the lawfulness of the processing before the withdrawal.
</p>
<h2>
    a. Consent to risk identification
</h2>
<p>
    To withdraw your consent, you can disable the risk identification feature
    or delete the app. If you would like to use the risk identification feature
    again, you can re-enable the feature or reinstall the app.
</p>
<h2>
    b. Consent to test registration
</h2>
<p>
    To withdraw your consent, you can delete the test registration in the app.
    The token for retrieving the test result will consequently be deleted from
    the app memory, so that the token can no longer be assigned on the server
    system. It will not be possible to register the same test again. If you
    wish to register a new test, you will be asked to grant your consent again.
</p>
<h2>
    c. Consent to warning feature
</h2>
<p>
    To withdraw your consent, you will need to delete the app. Your random IDs
    already transmitted to the server system will consequently be deleted from
    the app memory and can no longer be assigned. If you wish to activate the
    warning feature again, you will need to reinstall the app and grant your
    consent again. Once registered in the app, a test result cannot be used
    again to warn others.
</p>
<p>
    Once your random IDs and transmission risk values have been transmitted,
    the RKI has no way of deleting them from the positive lists distributed by
    the server system or from users’ smartphones. If you also wish to delete
    your exposure data stored in the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System, you
    may be able to manually delete it in your smartphone’s system settings.
    Please also note the information in Section 5 b.
</p>
<h1>
    13. What other rights do you have under data protection law?
</h1>
<p>
    If the RKI processes your personal data, you also have the following data
    protection rights:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The rights under Articles 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 and 21 GDPR,
    </li>
    <li>
        the right to contact the official
        RKI data protection officer
        (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Institut/OrgEinheiten/Datenschutz/Datenschutz_node.html)
        and raise your concerns (Art. 38(4) GDPR) and
    </li>
    <li>
        the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection
        supervisory authority. To do so, you can either contact your local
        supervisory authority or the authority responsible for the RKI. The
        supervisory authority responsible for the RKI is the Federal
        Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information,
        Graurheindorfer Straße 153, 53117 Bonn.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In respect of the joint processing performed by the transnational exchange
    server, you also have these data protection rights vis-à-vis the health
    authorities responsible for data processing in the countries participating
    in the exchange server (see Section 7).
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the rights mentioned above can only be fulfilled if the
    data on which your claim is based can be clearly assigned to you. This
    would only be possible if the app were used to collect further personal
    data that would allow the data transmitted to the server system to be
    clearly assigned to you or your smartphone. Since this is not necessary for
    the purposes of the app, the RKI is not obliged to collect such additional
    data (Art. 11(2) GDPR). Moreover, this would run counter to the stated
    objective of collecting as little data as possible. For this reason, it
    will generally not be possible to fulfil the above data protection rights
    even if you provide additional information about your identity.
</p>
<h1>
    14. Data protection officer and contact
</h1>
<p>
    If you have any questions or concerns regarding data protection, you are
    welcome to send them to the RKI’s official data protection officer by post

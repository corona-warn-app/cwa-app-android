</p>
<h1>
    1. Who is the Corona-Warn-App published by?
</h1>
<p>
    This app is published by the Robert Koch Institute (<strong>RKI</strong>)
    for the German Federal Government. The RKI is also responsible for ensuring
    that your personal data is processed in accordance with data protection regulations.
</p>
<p>
    If, after testing positive for coronavirus, you use the app’s transnational warning feature, it
    is also possible to warn users of official coronavirus apps of other countries whom you have
    encountered. In this case, the RKI and the competent health authorities of the countries
    participating in the respective transnational warning systems are so-called joint controllers,
    meaning they are jointly responsible for data processing. Please refer to Section 7 for more
    details.
</p>
<h1>
    2. Is using the app voluntary?
</h1>
<p>
    Using the app is voluntary. It is entirely up to you whether you install the app, which of the
    app’s features you use, and whether you share data with others. All of the app’s features that
    require the transfer of your personal data to the RKI or to other users will obtain your express
    consent in advance. If you do not give your consent or if you subsequently withdraw it, this
    will not result in any disadvantages for you.
</p>
<h1>
    3. On what legal basis is your data processed?
</h1>
<p>
    The RKI will only process your data if you have given your express consent beforehand. The legal
    basis is Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(a) GDPR and, in the case of health data, Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR. After
    giving your consent, you can withdraw it at any time (so-called right of withdrawal). Please
    refer to Section 12 for further information about your right of withdrawal. On the basis of Art.
    6(1) Sentence 1(e) GDPR in conjunction with Sect. 3 of the German Federal Data Protection Act
    (BDSG), the processing of access data for the provision of daily statistics (see Section 6 e.)
    is performed as part of the RKI’s duty to inform the public pursuant to Sect. 4(4) of the Act on
    Successor Agencies to the Federal Health Agency (BGA-NachfG).
</p>
<h1>
    4. Who is the app aimed at?
</h1>
<p>
    The app is aimed at people who are resident in Germany and at least 16
    years old.
</p>
<h1>5. What data is processed?
</h1>
<p>
    The app’s entire system has been programmed to process as little personal data as possible. This
    means that, when you use exposure logging, warn other users, or retrieve a test result, the
    system does not need to collect any data that would allow the RKI or other users to infer your
    identity, your name, your location or other personal details. The only exception to this is the
    optional feature for proving a rapid test result, which allows you to display a confirmation
    issued in your name for negative rapid test results (see Section 6 c.).
</p>
<p>
    The app therefore also refrains by default from using analysis tools to evaluate the way you use
    it. Only if you expressly agree to voluntarily share data (see Section 5 g.), will certain data
    about your use of the app be transmitted to the RKI.
</p>
<p>
    The data processed by the app can be grouped into the following categories:
</p>
<h2>
    a. Access data
</h2>
<p>
    Every time the app exchanges data over the internet with the RKI’s server
    system (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>server system</strong>), the
    server system processes so-called access data. This is necessary so that
    the app can retrieve current data (e.g. for warnings) or transmit certain
    data stored on your smartphone to the server system. This access data
    includes the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        IP address
    </li>
    <li>
        Date and time of retrieval
    </li>
    <li>
        Transmitted data volume (or packet length)
    </li>
    <li>
        Notification of whether the data exchange was a success.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This access data is processed to maintain and secure the technical
    operation of the app and the server system. You will not be identified
    personally as a user of the app and no user profile will be created. Your
    IP address will not be stored beyond the end of the usage procedure.
</p>
<p>
    In order to prevent unauthorised parties from using your IP address to
    associate your data with you when you use the app, the app only ever
    accesses the server system via a special access server. This access server
    then forwards the data requested or transmitted by the app to the
    appropriate server, but without your IP address, meaning that your IP
    address is no longer processed within the server system.
</p>
<h2>
    b. Exposure data
</h2>
<p>
    As soon as you enable your iPhone’s or your Android smartphone’s COVID-19
    exposure notification system (which is called “Exposure Notifications” or
    “COVID-19 Exposure Notifications” respectively), your smartphone transmits
    so-called exposure data via Bluetooth, which other smartphones in your
    vicinity can record. Your smartphone, in turn, also receives the exposure
    data of other smartphones. The exposure data transmitted by your smartphone
    comprises:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Random identification numbers (hereinafter referred to as <strong>random IDs</strong>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Bluetooth protocol version
    </li>
    <li>
        Bluetooth transmit power in decibel-milliwatts (dBm).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If exposure to another smartphone is recorded, the exposure data also
    includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Day, time and duration of the contact
    </li>
    <li>
        Bluetooth signal strength in dBm.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The random IDs are changed regularly. This helps prevent your smartphone
    from being identified using these random IDs. The exposure data transmitted
    by your smartphone and the exposure data recorded when you come into
    contact with other app users are stored on your smartphone and deleted
    after 14 days. The exposure data transmitted by your smartphone is
    processed in the same way when it is recorded by the smartphones of other
    app users.
</p>
<p>
    Please note: the COVID-19 exposure notification system functionality is
    part of your operating system. The providers responsible for this system
    are therefore Apple (if you have an iPhone) and Google (if you have an
    Android smartphone). In this respect, the data processing is subject to
    these companies’ own privacy policies, which means that the RKI is not
    responsible for this and has no influence on it. Depending on the version
    and configuration of your operating system, the actual names, operating
    steps and settings options may differ from those described in this privacy
    notice. More information is available from the respective providers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you have an Android smartphone, you can find information from Google
        on your device by going to “Settings” &gt; “Google” &gt; “COVID-19
        exposure notifications” and tapping on “Learn more”.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have an iPhone, you can find information from Apple on your
        device by going to “Settings” &gt; “Exposure Notifications” and tapping
        on “How Exposure Notifications work ...”.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    c. Rapid test data
</h2>
<p>
    If you have taken rapid antigen tests at a testing centre, you can retrieve the results of these
    through the app. If you choose to use this service, your testing centre will generate an
    individual QR code for you to scan with the app. The QR code contains a unique code for your
    rapid test, and the time you were tested, in encoded form. If, in the event of a negative rapid
    test result, you wish to have the test result displayed along with your name in the app for
    verification purposes (see Section 6 c. for more information about this feature), the QR code
    will contain further data provided by you in encoded form.
</p>
<h2>
    d. Event data
</h2>
<p>
    If you visit an event (such as a party or concert) or a place (such as a shop or restaurant),
    you can record your stay there in the app. Event organisers and business owners can provide
    guests with a QR code for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
    As a guest, you can “check in” when you arrive by simply scanning this QR code with the app.
    When leaving the event or place, you can “check out” again in the app. The app then remembers
    that you were at that event or place, and when you were there. If a guest later tests positive
    for coronavirus and activates the warning feature via their app, then all other guests who were
    checked in at the same time will receive a warning.
</p>
<p>
    If you scan a QR code as a guest, the event details provided by the host (name of the
    event/place, address/location, typical length of stay and, if applicable, the time when the
    event started) as well as the check-in time will be stored on your smartphone. In addition, your
    app will derive an encrypted identifier (hereinafter referred to as the event ID) that can be
    uniquely assigned to the event based on the information contained in the QR code. No conclusions
    about the event or the place can be drawn from the event ID. When you check out in the app or
    are automatically checked out after the time preset by the host, the check-out time will be
    stored on your smartphone.
</p>
<p>
    An entry will also be created in your contact journal by default. Sections 5 f. and 6.f. explain
    this in more detail. If you do not want to create an entry in your contact journal for an event
    or place, you can simply switch off this feature using the corresponding toggle switch.
</p>
<p>
    If you as a host create a QR code for your guests, the event details you provide and a random
    code will be stored in the QR code. The random code ensures that different places and events for
    which the same event details have been entered will later have different event IDs. The QR codes
    you create are stored on your smartphone. Under “My QR codes”, you can delete the QR codes you
    have created at any time.
</p>
<p>
    Using the event check-in feature is voluntary. You decide yourself whether you want to create a
    QR code for your event or place, and whether to check in at an event or place.
</p>
<p>
    Under “My check-ins”, you can check and delete your previous check-ins and also adjust the
    check-out time.
</p>
<h2>
    e. Health data
</h2>
<p>
    Health data is any data containing information about a person’s health.
    This includes not only information about past and current illnesses, but
    also about a person’s risk of illness (such as the risk that a person has
    been infected with coronavirus). The app processes health data in the
    following cases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        When a possible exposure is identified
    </li>
    <li>
        If you use the app to retrieve a test result
    </li>
    <li>
        If you use the app to warn other users and guests from events or places you visited at the
        same time that they may be infected
    </li>
    <li>
        If you provide information about the onset of any coronavirus symptoms.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Section 6 explains this in more detail.
</p>
<h2>
    f. Entries in the contact journal
</h2>
<p>
    If you use the contact journal to note when and where you met certain people and record certain
    details of the encounter or contact details for people and places, this information is stored in
    encrypted form on your smartphone. The contact journal entries are only there to help you
    remember. The RKI and other agencies cannot gain access to entries in the contact journal. The
    contact journal can help you to keep track of your personal contacts over the last 14 days. If
    you test positive for coronavirus and the public health office (Gesundheitsamt) requests your
    assistance with contact tracing, then you can quickly provide the information it needs.
</p>
<p>
    Using the contact journal is voluntary. You personally decide whether to store entries in the
    contact journal. In this respect, you are also responsible for what you record. For this reason,
    we kindly ask you to respect the privacy of the people you include in your contact journal. You
    should not share your entries with third parties or via insecure communication channels. The
    competent public health office will tell you what information it needs from you for contact
    tracing purposes, and how you can provide it.
</p>
<h2>
    g. Usage data (data sharing)
</h2>
<p>
    If you enable data sharing, the app will transmit certain data about your use of the app
    (hereinafter referred to as usage data) once a day to the RKI. This usage data concerns the
    possible exposures displayed by the app, warnings that have been received and triggered, test
    results that have been retrieved, and technical information about your smartphone’s operating
    system. Specifically, the usage data includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The date when you shared the data (i.e. the date of transmission)</li>
    <li>Changes to the warning history compared to the previous day</li>
    <li>What risk status was shown to you at the time when you used the data sharing feature</li>
    <li>Information about which encounters served as a basis on which to calculate the risk status
    </li>
    <li>Information about the model and version of your smartphone and the version of your app as
        well as the operating system you are using.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you retrieved a test result via the app:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Whether the test result was positive or negative</li>
    <li>What risk was shown to you at the time when you registered the test</li>
    <li>How much time has passed since the last possible exposure and its display in the app until
        the relevant test registration
    </li>
    <li>Whether you have used the feature for warning others and, if so, which step you reached in
        the process (e.g. the part that asks about your symptoms)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you have used the warning feature:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Whether you provided information about the onset of symptoms</li>
    <li>When you gave your consent to warn others (before or after registering the test)</li>
    <li>Whether you completed the entire warning process or whether you aborted the process before
        the end (for example, because you did not wait for confirmation that your data had been
        successfully transmitted)
    </li>
    <li>How many hours it took before you received your test result after registering your test</li>
    <li>How many days passed since the last notification of an elevated risk before the warning
        feature was used
    </li>
    <li>How many hours have passed since the test was registered.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition, you can provide further optional information about your region and age group, which
    will be transmitted to the RKI together with the usage data.
</p>
<p>
    The RKI will compile the usage data and any optional information into anonymised statistics and
    analyse it to assess the effectiveness and functioning of the app, and draw conclusions
    regarding the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
    Participation in data sharing is voluntary. To enable the data sharing feature, the authenticity
    of your app first needs to be confirmed (please note the further information about this under
    Sections 5 i. and 11).
</p>
h. Participation in a survey
</h2>
<p>
    Some app users are offered to participate in a survey by the RKI. This offer to participate in
    the survey will usually be contingent on certain events registered in the app (e.g. an elevated
    risk being displayed). By taking part in the survey, you will help the RKI to assess the
    effectiveness of the app, to improve the app and, for example, to understand whether and how
    warnings sent via the app help to prevent further infections.
</p>
<p>
    Participation in the surveys is voluntary. You decide yourself whether you want to participate
    in a survey and whether data should be transmitted to the RKI for this purpose. The surveys take
    place on a website outside of the app, which you will be redirected to. To enable participation
    in a survey, the authenticity of your app first needs to be confirmed (please note the further
    information about this in Sections 5 i. and 11).
</p>
<h2>
    i. Confirmation of the authenticity of your app
</h2>
<p>
    Before you can use some of the app’s features, the authenticity of your app first needs to be
    checked and confirmed to the RKI. Specifically, this authentication serves to determine whether
    you are using a manipulated or counterfeit (“fake”) version of the app. The authentication uses
    a feature of your operating system. Your smartphone generates a unique identifier and sends it
    to your operating system provider (if you use an Android smartphone, data is transmitted to
    Google; if you use an iPhone, data is transmitted to Apple). The identifier contains information
    about the version of your smartphone and the version of the app. It is possible for your
    operating system provider to infer your identity from the identifier and learn that your
    smartphone has been authenticated. Your operating system provider does not receive any other
    information, such as exposure data, from the app. Your operating system provider will use the
    identifier to confirm the authenticity of your app to the RKI. Using the feature for confirming
    the authenticity of your app is voluntary. However, if you do not agree to having the
    authenticity of your app confirmed, other features of the app may not be available to you.
</p>
<h1>
    6. Why is your data processed?
</h1>
<h3>
    a. Exposure logging

</h3>
<p>
    Exposure logging is part of the app’s main functionality. It serves to warn you of
    possible exposure to people who have tested positive for coronavirus (“possible
    exposures”) in a number of different countries, to assess the risk that you have been
    infected as a result of the exposure, and to provide you with health advice and
    recommendations for what to do next.

</p>
<p>
    For this purpose, the app retrieves an up-to-date positive list from the server system several
    times a day. This list contains information from users who have used the warning feature in
    their app, which is the official coronavirus app in any country participating in the
    transnational warning system (see Section 7). This positive list contains the random IDs of
    users who have activated the warning feature and, if applicable, information about the onset of
    symptoms. If the users who have activated the warning feature were checked in at events, the
    positive list also contains the relevant event IDs and the duration of the check-ins (check-in
    and check-out times).
</p>
<p>
    The random IDs and event IDs on the positive lists also contain a transmission risk value and an
    indication of the type of diagnosis (see Section 6 d.).
</p>
<p>
    The app passes the random IDs from the positive list to the COVID-19 exposure
    notification system, which compares them with the random IDs it has recorded
    from your encounters with other users. If the COVID-19 exposure notification
    system detects a match, it transfers to the app the exposure data recorded
    for the possible exposure in question.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, the app matches event IDs from the positive list with the event IDs from your
    check-ins to determine whether you were at an event or place at the same time as users who have
    tested positive for coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
    The app evaluates this exposure data, event IDs (including the associated check-in and check-out
    times) as well as the information on the positive lists (transmission risk value; information
    about the onset of symptoms) in order to determine your risk of infection. The rules for
    evaluating this information (for example, how the duration of a contact influences the risk of
    infection) are based on the RKI’s latest scientific findings. In the event of new findings, the
    RKI can update the evaluation rules by adjusting the evaluation settings in the app. In this
    case, the new evaluation settings are sent to the app together with the positive lists.
</p>
<p>
    The risk of infection is calculated exclusively offline in the app and is not
    passed on to the COVID-19 exposure notification system or any other recipient
    (including the RKI, other health authorities in Germany or other countries,
    Apple, Google and other third parties).

</p>
<p>
    If a risk of infection is identified for you, this will be displayed in the app. If an elevated
    risk is displayed, this means that you encountered one or more other users who later tested
    positive for coronavirus and used the warning feature in their app, or that such users were
    checked in at an event or place at the same time as you.
</p>
<p>
    The risk calculated for each of the last 14 days is displayed in the calendar view of the
    contact journal. Please refrain from drawing false conclusions about the source of any risk: a
    risk calculated and displayed for a certain day may well be due to your having encountered users
    unknown to you without realising it, and will not necessarily have anything to do with the
    people, places or events you recorded in the contact journal.
</p>
<h2>
    b. Retrieving a test result
</h2>
<p>
    If you have taken a coronavirus test (PCR test or rapid antigen test), you can retrieve your
    test result via the app. The app will notify you as soon as your test result is available. For
    this to work, the testing facility (e.g. testing laboratory or testing centre) needs to be
    connected to the server system and, as part of the testing procedure, you must have given
    separate consent to your test result being sent. It is not possible to display test results from
    testing facilities that are not connected to the app’s server system. If you have not received a
    QR code, then you cannot use this feature either.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Scanning the QR code</u>
</p>
<p>
    In order to retrieve your test result via the app, you will need to scan the QR code using your
    smartphone’s camera. The QR code contains a code number that is read during scanning and is
    assigned to your test. If the test is a rapid antigen test, then the QR code will also contain
    the rapid test data described in Section 5 c. After reading the code number, the app ‘hashes’
    it. This means that the app performs a certain mathematical procedure in order to convert the
    code number in such a way that it can no longer be identified. However, it is still possible to
    clearly assign the hashed code number to your test result. As soon as your smartphone is
    connected to the internet, the app will transmit the hashed code number to the server system.
    The server system then provides a digital access key (a so-called token), which is stored in the
    app. The token is linked to the hashed code number in the server system. The app now deletes the
    code number that has been hashed on your smartphone and keeps only the token. Once the QR code
    has been used in this way, it becomes invalid and can no longer be used by anyone. This ensures
    that no other users can use your QR code to retrieve your test result.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Filing of the test result</u>
</p>
<p>
    As soon as your test result is available, the testing facility stores it in the RKI’s test
    result database using only the hashed code number. The test result database is located on a
    special server within the server system. The testing facility generates the hashed code number
    based on the same QR code that you received.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Retrieval of the test result</u>
</p>
<p>
    Using the token stored in the app, the app regularly requests the status of
    your test from the server system. The server system then informs the app of
    the current status (result not yet available / result available). As soon
    as your test result is available, the outcome (i.e. whether you have tested
    positive or negative for coronavirus) is also transmitted to the app. If
    you have enabled the test status notification (under “Settings” &gt;
    “Notifications”), you will be notified. The test result will not be
    displayed until you open the app.
</p>
<p>
    If you have tested positive for coronavirus, the app uses the token again
    to request a TAN (transaction number) from the server system. The TAN is
    required to ensure that no false warnings are transmitted to other users.
    For this purpose, the server system reassigns the token to the hashed code
    number and requests confirmation from the test result database that a
    positive test result really does exist for the hashed code number. If this
    is confirmed, the server system generates the TAN and transmits it to the
    app. A copy of the TAN remains on the server system.
</p>
<h2>
    c. Proof of a rapid test result
</h2>
<p>
    If you retrieve the result of a rapid antigen test and, when you were at the testing facility,
    you selected the option to have your name displayed in the event of a negative test result, then
    a negative result will be displayed along with your name, date of birth and the time you were
    tested. To do this, the app uses the corresponding rapid test data which it reads when scanning
    the QR code. The rapid test data will be deleted as soon as the negative rapid test result is no
    longer displayed in the app.
</p>
<p>
    If necessary, you can show the test result displayed in the app to prove to third parties that
    you took a rapid test and the result of that test was negative. Please find out about applicable
    requirements for the recognition of digital test certificates where you are located. Please
    note:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The RKI cannot guarantee that a rapid test result displayed in the app will be recognised by
        the competent authorities and other authorised bodies that may or must require you to
        provide proof of testing (e.g. shops, employers).
    </li>
    <li>You are not obliged to use the app’s certification feature. If you have to prove your test
        result to third parties, you can also present the proof in another form subject to the legal
        requirements (which may vary depending on the federal state).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Your name will not be displayed if you retrieve a positive rapid test result. In this case, your
    name and date of birth will be immediately deleted from the app memory. Your other rapid test
    data (code, time you were tested) will be deleted as soon as the positive rapid test result is
    no longer displayed in the app.
</p>
<h2>
    d. Warning others
</h2>
<p>
    If you have tested positive for coronavirus and share your random IDs with the app, then it is
    possible to warn other users whom you have encountered. In addition, users who were checked in
    at the same events or places at the same time as you will be warned. In this case, the app
    transmits the following data to the server system:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Your own random IDs from the last 14 days
    </li>
    <li>
        The event IDs of events or places where you have checked in during the last 14 days,
        including the recorded check-in and check-out times
    </li>
    <li>
        Any information about the onset of symptoms
    </li>
    <li>
        Your TAN (see Section 6 b.).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Before passing on your test result (more precisely: before transmitting your random IDs and
    event IDs, including the recorded check-in and check-out times) to the server system, the app
    adds a transmission risk value to the data and also specifies the type of test performed. The
    transmission risk value is an estimate of how infectious you were on each day of the 14-day
    period. Since how infectious a person is or was depends on the duration and course of the
    infection, it can be taken into account, for example, that the more time has passed since the
    onset of symptoms, the lower the risk of a person spreading the virus on the day of a possible
    exposure. These additional transmission risk values allow a more precise determination of the
    likelihood that you have infected other users.
</p>
<p>
    The information requested by the app about the onset of symptoms is
    optional. However, this information may help to calculate the transmission
    risk value even more accurately. If you do not provide information about
    your symptoms, then the transmission risk values will be calculated
    assuming a typical case of infection with coronavirus, i.e. the more time
    has passed since a random ID was used, the lower the associated
    transmission risk value.
</p>
<p>
    <u>If you have not retrieved your test result in the app:</u>
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a positive rapid antigen test result, you can only warn other people if you
    retrieved the test result in the app.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a positive PCR test result, on the other hand, you can warn others even if you
    received the test result outside the app. To do this, select the “Request TAN” procedure. The
    app will then prompt you to call the app hotline. A hotline worker will then ask you a few
    questions to make sure that you really have tested positive for coronavirus. This is to prevent
    false warnings being transmitted, either by accident or intentionally. Once you have answered
    these questions sufficiently, you will be asked for your mobile/telephone number and your name.
    This is so that you can be called back later and given a unique TAN to enter in the app. Your
    mobile/telephone number and your name will be temporarily stored for this purpose only and
    deleted after an hour at the latest. Immediately after your call, the hotline worker will
    generate a unique TAN via a special access to the server system and then call you back to tell
    you this TAN. A TAN is only valid for one hour and will therefore be deleted no later than one
    hour after it has been passed on to you. After a valid TAN is entered in the app, it is
    transmitted to the server system. The TAN thus makes it possible to check that a positive test
    result really does exist and thus prevent false alarms. The app then receives a token from the
    server system, as it does after a valid QR code is scanned (see “Retrieving a test result” in
    Section 6 b. above).
</p>
<p>
    Please note that in rare cases, if you use the warning feature, people you know personally who
    also use the app and then receive a warning, may infer that the warning came from you. This may
    be the case if a person whom you know had no contact with anyone except with you on the day for
    which the possible exposure is displayed.
</p>
<h2>
    e. Using the app for information purposes only
</h2>
<p>
    The app automatically receives the daily statistics that appear in the app
    via the server system. This generates access data. Websites linked in the
    app, such as <u>www.bundesregierung.de</u>, are opened and displayed in
    your smartphone’s standard browser (Android smartphones) or within the app (iPhones).
    Which data is processed in this context depends on the respective providers
    of the websites accessed.
</p>
<h2>
    f. Contact journal
</h2>
<p>
    The contact journal is an additional feature of the app. What you enter in the contact journal
    serves as a reminder for you, and can only be accessed by you. If you later test positive for
    coronavirus and the public health office (Gesundheitsamt) requires your assistance with contact
    tracing, then you can provide the information that it needs more quickly. If the app calculates
    an elevated risk for you for a particular day, then seeing this information may help you to warn
    the people you have had contact with early on. This will give your contacts the chance to decide
    whether to change their plans if necessary, i.e. to meet up with fewer people and thus reduce
    the risk of causing undetected infections.
</p>
<h2>
    g. Data sharing
</h2>
<p>
    Share Data is an additional feature of the app. The usage data and other voluntary
    information transmitted to the RKI by the data sharing feature are used to assess the
    effectiveness of the app and enable the following improvements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Improving exposure logging – The aim is to improve the accuracy and reliability of the
        technical calculation of risks of infection. For this purpose, information about possible
        exposures and warnings displayed to you is analysed. The calculation method can then be
        fine-tuned.
    </li>
    <li>
        Improving app navigation for users – The aim is to make it easier to use the app. For this
        purpose, information about the individual steps that users take in the app is analysed. This
        makes it possible to make labels and texts clearer, and buttons can be placed in such a way
        that they can be found more easily. In addition, displays can be customised for different
        smartphone models.
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing information and assistance with the app – The aim is to identify whether there are
        problems when the app is used, for example with certain testing facilities and laboratories
        or in certain regions. This can be determined if, for example, the data sharing feature
        reveals that test results are available later in certain regions than in others. In this
        way, the competent health authorities can also be specifically informed of potential
        technical disruptions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Improving statistics about the pandemic – The data can provide information about the
        temporal and spatial distribution of certain events in the pandemic and allow the
        authorities to respond more quickly to certain developments.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The usage data and other voluntary information will be stored and analysed without any
    connection to your name or identity. This means the RKI will not find out who you are or who you
    have met.
</p>
<h2>
    h. Surveys
</h2>
<p>
    The surveys take place on a website outside of the app, which you will be redirected to. The app
    will not transmit any data to the RKI in connection with the surveys. The purposes of an RKI
    survey are described in the information about the survey on the survey website.
</p>
<h2>
    i. Confirmation of the authenticity of your app
</h2>
<p>
    A feature of your smartphone’s operating system is used to confirm the authenticity of your app.
    This ensures that only app users whose app is functioning properly can share their data or
    participate in surveys. This prevents the statistics and survey results from being distorted.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that your operating system provider may be able to tell that your smartphone has
    been authenticated and may therefore be able to infer your identity. However, your operating
    system provider will not receive any further information about your use of the Corona-Warn-App.
</p>
<h1>
    7. How does the transnational warning system work?
</h1>
<p>
    To ensure that users are also warned by the official coronavirus apps of
    other countries, the RKI, together with several official healthcare bodies
    and authorities in other countries (hereinafter referred to as <strong>health
    authorities</strong>) has set up central warning servers
    for sharing warnings between countries (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>exchange
    server</strong>).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The exchange server of the participating countries among European Member States uses the
        digital infrastructure of the eHealth Network established between the Member States and the
        EU.
    </li>
    <li>In order to also enable warnings between users of the Swiss coronavirus app and the
        Corona-Warn-App, the RKI also operates another exchange server together with Switzerland
        (Federal Office of Public Health of the Swiss Confederation).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The national server systems of the coronavirus apps connected to the exchange servers regularly
    transmit their own positive lists to the exchange servers and receive the positive lists of the
    other countries. Transnational warnings can only be transmitted based on a positive PCR test and
    only based on encounters recorded in the COVID-19 exposure notification system. Event IDs and
    random IDs based on positive rapid antigen tests are therefore not transmitted to the exchange
    servers.
</p>
<p>
    Each server system merges the positive lists received in this way with its
    own positive list, which allows the exposure logging feature to also take
    into account possible exposures involving users of another coronavirus app
    (see point 6 d.) The other participating countries proceed in the same way
    with the positive lists provided by the RKI.
</p>
<p>
    Only countries whose coronavirus apps are compatible with each other and
    which guarantee a comparably high level of data protection can participate
    in the exchange servers. In particular, this requires that the
    coronavirus apps of the participating countries also use the COVID-19
    exposure notification system, are approved by the respective national
    health authorities, and respect the privacy of their users.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The technical and organisational details of this cooperation concerning the exchange server
        operated within the EU are laid down in an EU Commission Decision (Commission Implementing
        Decision (EU) 2020/1023 of 15 July 2020, which is available at <a
                href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2020/1023/oj">
            https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2020/1023/oj</a>). Under it, together with the
        respective competent health authorities of the participating countries, the RKI is a joint
        controller under data protection law, meaning it is responsible for processing the
        information contained on the positive lists (random IDs and, if applicable, information
        about the onset of symptoms) on the exchange servers in order to enable the transnational
        exposure logging and warning system.
    </li>
    <li>The operation and data exchange of the joint exchange server with Switzerland is regulated
        in an individual agreement between the RKI and Switzerland, available at <a
                href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/WarnApp/Warn_App.html">
            https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/WarnApp/Warn_App.html</a>.
        Under the agreement, the technical operation of the exchange server is carried out by the
        Federal Office of Public Health of the Swiss Confederation. Together with the Federal Office
        of Public Health of the Swiss Confederation, the RKI is a joint controller under data
        protection law, meaning it is responsible for the storage, provision and subsequent erasure
        of the positive lists.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please note that the list of participating countries is subject to change.
    The current list, with details of the competent health authorities in each
    case, can be found in the FAQs available at
    https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/#interoperability_countries .
</p>
<h1>8. What permissions does the app require?
</h1>
<p>
    The app requires access to a number of your smartphone’s features and
    interfaces. For this purpose, you need to grant the app certain
    permissions. The permission system depends on your operating system’s
    specifications. For example, your smartphone may combine individual
    permissions into permission categories, where you can only agree to the
    permission category as a whole. Please note that without the permissions
    requested by the app, you will not be able to use some or all of the app
    features.
</p>
<h2>
    a. Technical requirements (all smartphones)
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The app requires an internet connection in order to exchange data with
        the server system.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Bluetooth feature must be enabled so that your smartphone can
        transmit its own random IDs and record the random IDs of other
        smartphones.
    </li>
    <li>
        The app needs to be able to run in the background on your smartphone in
        order to automatically identify your risk of infection and check the
        status of your test. If you deny the app permission to run in the
        background, then you must start all actions in the app itself.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    b. Android smartphones
</h2>
<p>
    If you are using an Android smartphone, the following system features must
    also be enabled:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Android COVID-19 exposure notification system (COVID-19 Exposure
        Notifications)
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have a smartphone running on Android version 10 or lower,
        location services need to be enabled for your smartphone to search for
        Bluetooth signals from other smartphones. Please note that no location
        data is collected in this process.
    </li>
    <li>
        The notification feature must be enabled so that you can be notified of
        changes to your risk of infection and the status of test results. The
        notification feature is enabled by default in the operating system.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The app also requires the following permissions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The features for retrieving a test result and checking in at an event require access to the
        camera in order to scan QR codes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    c. iPhones (Apple iOS)
</h2>
<p>
    If you are using an iPhone, the following system features must be enabled:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The iOS COVID-19 exposure notification system (Exposure Notifications)
    </li>
    <li>
        Notifications must be enabled so that you can be notified of changes to
        your risk of infection and the status of your test.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The app also requires the following permissions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The features for retrieving a test result and checking in at an event require access to the
        camera in order to scan QR codes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>9. When will your data be deleted?
</h1>
<p>
    The storage period depends on the purposes or app features for which your
    data has been stored. When determining the storage period, the RKI takes
    into account the latest scientific findings on the incubation period (i.e.
    the period between exposure to infection and the appearance of the first
    symptoms, which is up to 14 days) as well as on how long there is a risk of
    an infected person infecting someone else after the end of the incubation
    period. Unless otherwise specified under Section 6, the following storage
    periods apply:
</p>
<h2>
    a. Data on your smartphone
</h2>
<p>
    The positive lists are deleted from the app memory after 14 days. Event data under “My
    check-ins” is automatically deleted after 14 days. Alternatively, you can delete entries under
    “My check-ins” manually at any time. The infection risk determined for you (e.g. “low risk”) is
    deleted from the app memory after each update, but after 14 days at the latest. If you have
    retrieved a positive test result, the token in the app memory is deleted as soon as you activate
    the warning feature. Your entries in the contact journal will be stored on your smartphone for
    16 days before being automatically deleted. You can also delete these entries yourself at any
    time. Please note that if entries are added to the contact journal when you check in at an event
    or place, these will still be stored there even after you delete the associated check-in.
</p>
<h2>
    b. Data on server systems
</h2>
<p>
    Positive lists are deleted from all server systems (including the exchange server) after 14
    days. All other data, with the exception of data transmitted by the data sharing feature and to
    confirm the authenticity of your app, will be deleted after 21 days at the latest.
</p>
<h2>
    c. Share Data
</h2>
<p>
    Usage data and other voluntary information transmitted to the RKI by the data sharing feature
    will be deleted after 180 days.
</p>
<h2>
    d. Confirmation of the authenticity of your app
</h2>
<p>
    The identifier generated by your smartphone to confirm the authenticity of your app will be
    deleted from the server system after 30 days after transmission to the RKI.
</p>
<h1>
    10. Who will receive your data?
</h1>
<p>
    If you warn other users of a positive PCR test via the app, your test result (in the form of
    your random IDs from the last 14 days) as well as optional information you provide about the
    onset of your symptoms will be forwarded to the competent health authorities of each of the
    countries participating in the exchange servers. From there, they will be passed on to the
    server systems of the coronavirus apps of those countries participating in the transnational
    warning system. The server systems of the national coronavirus apps then distribute this
    information to their own users as part of the positive lists. Event IDs are only distributed to
    users of the Corona-Warn-App via the RKI’s server system. In the event of a warning based on a
    positive rapid antigen test, your data will not be passed on to the exchange servers.
</p>
<p>
    The competent national health authorities have commissioned the EU Commission, as data
    processor, to operate and maintain the joint exchange server of the participating EU countries.
    The exchange server for transnational warnings between the Corona-Warn-App and the Swiss
    coronavirus app is operated and maintained by the Federal Office of Public Health of the Swiss
    Confederation in consultation with the RKI.
</p>
<p>
    The RKI has commissioned T-Systems International GmbH and SAP Deutschland
    SE &amp; Co. KG to operate and maintain part of the technical
    infrastructure of the app (e.g. server system, hotline), meaning that these
    two companies are processors under data protection law and acting on the
    RKI’s behalf. The EU Commission has also commissioned these companies, as
    sub-processors, with the technical provision and management of the
    participating countries’ joint warning system.
</p>
<p>
    Otherwise, the RKI will only pass on your data collected in connection with
    your use of the app to third parties if the RKI is legally obliged to do so
    or if this is necessary for legal action or criminal prosecution in the
    case of attacks on the app’s technical infrastructure. In other cases,
    personal data will not generally be passed on by the RKI.
</p>
<h1>
    11. Is your data transferred to countries outside the EU?
</h1>
<p>
    If you activate the warning feature based on a positive PCR test, your random IDs will also be
    transmitted to Switzerland to the exchange server that is operated by the RKI together with the
    Federal Office of Public Health of the Swiss Confederation. In the event of a warning based on a
    positive rapid antigen test, no such transmission of your data will take place.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the confirmation of the authenticity of your app may involve the transfer of data
    to a country outside the EU. The identifier generated by your smartphone, which contains
    information about the version of your smartphone and the app, will be transmitted to the
    provider of your smartphone’s operating system (Apple or Google). This may result in data being
    transferred to third countries, in particular the US. There, the level of data protection may
    not be considered equivalent under European law and it may not be possible to enforce your
    European data protection rights. In particular, there is a possibility that once the transmitted
    data reaches the operating system provider, it may be accessed and analysed by security
    authorities in the third country, for example by linking the data with other information.
    However, this only concerns the submitted identifier. It does not concern other information from
    the app, such as exposure data.
</p>
<p>
    Otherwise, the data transmitted by the app is processed exclusively on servers in Germany or in
    another country in the EU (or the European Economic Area), which are therefore subject to the
    strict requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
</p>
<h1>
    12. How can you withdraw your consent?
</h1>
<p>
    You have the right to withdraw any consent you granted the RKI in the app
    at any time with effect for the future. Please note, however, that any
    processing of your data that has already been carried out cannot be
    reversed. In particular, once your random IDs have been transmitted, the
    RKI has no way of deleting these from other users’ smartphones.
</p>
<h2>
    a. Consent to “exposure logging”
</h2>
<p>
    You can withdraw your consent to the app’s exposure logging feature at any
    time by disabling the feature in the app’s settings or by deleting the app.
    If you would like to use the exposure logging feature again, you can
    re-enable the feature or reinstall the app.
</p>
<h2>
    b. Consent to “retrieving a test result”
</h2>
<p>
    You can withdraw your consent to the test result retrieval feature by
    displaying the test in the app and then deleting it. The token for
    retrieving the test result will consequently be deleted from the app
    memory, so that the token can no longer be assigned on the server system.
    It is not possible to assign the same test to your app again or to scan the
    same QR code again. If you have been tested again and wish to retrieve the
    test result, you will be asked for your consent again. If the test result
    is already available in the app, then you can no longer withdraw your
    consent.
</p>
<h2>
    c. Consent to “warning others”
</h2>
<p>
    If you would like to withdraw your consent to the transmission of your test result (or, more
    precisely, your consent to the transmission of your random IDs and event IDs, including the
    recorded check-in and check-out times, from the last 14 days) for warning other people, you can
    display the test and then disable “Warn others”. You can also delete entries for events or
    places under “My check-ins” and thus prevent data for these events from being used for warnings.
    This option is available as long as you have not yet transmitted your random IDs and event IDs
    to warn other users.

</p>
<p>
    After you have transmitted your random IDs, you can only withdraw your consent by deleting the
    app. Your random IDs already transmitted to the server system will consequently be deleted from
    the app memory and can no longer be assigned to you personally or your smartphone. If you wish
    to activate the warning feature again, you will need to reinstall the app and give your consent
    again. Once a test result has been assigned to your app and transmitted in order to warn others,
    it cannot be used again to warn others.
</p>
<p>
    If event IDs have already been transmitted to the server system, you can also delete them from
    the app memory, by deleting the entries for the events or places under “My check-ins”. Event IDs
    can then no longer be assigned to you personally or your smartphone.
</p>
<p>
    Once your random IDs, event IDs and transmission risk values have been transmitted, the RKI has
    no way of deleting them from the positive lists distributed by the server system or from users’
    smartphones. If you also wish to delete your exposure data stored in your smartphone’s COVID-19
    exposure notification system, you may be able to manually delete it in your smartphone’s system
    settings. Please also note the information in Section 5 b.

</p>
<h2>
    d. Consent to “event check-in”
</h2>
<p>
    You can delete entries for events or places at any time under “My check-ins”. This will prevent
    data about these events from being used by the feature for warning others, and event IDs from
    being assigned to you personally or your smartphone.
</p>
<h2>
    e. Consent to “share data”
</h2>
<p>
    You can withdraw your consent to the data sharing feature at any time by disabling the data
    donation feature in the app’s settings. The app will then no longer transmit your usage data and
    other voluntary information to the RKI on a daily basis. If you would like to allow data
    donation again, you can re-enable the feature in the settings.
</p>
<h2>
    f. Consent to “survey participation”
</h2>
<p>
    You do not give your consent to participate in an RKI survey in the app, but via the website on
    which the survey is conducted. There you will also find information about how you can withdraw
    your consent.
</p>
<h2>
    g. Consent to “confirmation of the authenticity of your app”
</h2>
<p>
    If you withdraw your consent to the confirmation of your app’s authenticity, this will not
    directly affect the related data processing. The transmission of the identifier generated by
    your smartphone to the operating system provider, and the verification and confirmation of the
    authenticity of your app, take place immediately after you have given your consent.
</p>
<h1>
    13. What other rights do you have under data protection law?
</h1>
<p>
    If the RKI processes your personal data, you also have the following data
    protection rights:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The rights under Art. 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 and 21 GDPR,
    </li>
    <li>
        the right to contact the official

    <li>
        the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory
        authority. To do so, you can either contact your local supervisory
        authority or the authority responsible for the RKI. The supervisory
        authority responsible for the RKI is the Federal Commissioner for Data
        Protection and Freedom of Information, Graurheindorfer Straße 153,
        53117 Bonn.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You also have these data protection rights vis-à-vis the health authorities
    responsible for data processing in the countries participating in the
    exchange server, insofar as you have transmitted your random IDs from
    recent days to warn other people (see Section 7).
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the rights mentioned above can only be fulfilled if the
    data on which your claim is based can be clearly assigned to you. This
    would only be possible if the app were used to collect further personal
    data that would allow the data transmitted to the server system to be
    clearly assigned to you or your smartphone. Since this is not necessary for
    the purposes of the app, the RKI is not obliged to collect such additional
    data (Art. 11(2) GDPR). Moreover, this would run counter to the stated
    objective of collecting as little data as possible. For this reason, it
    will generally not be possible to fulfil the above data protection rights
    even if you provide additional information about your identity.

    Privacy notice
</p>
<p>
    Corona-Warn-App
</p>
<p>
    This privacy notice explains what data is collected when you use the
    Corona-Warn-App, how that data is used, and your rights under data
    protection law.
</p>
<p>
    To ensure that this privacy notice can be understood by all users, we have
    made every effort to make it simple and as non-technical as possible.
</p>
<h2>
    1. Who has provided you with this app?
</h2>
<p>
    The Corona-Warn-App (the “<strong>App</strong>”) is provided by the Robert
    Koch Institute, Nordufer 20, 13353 Berlin (the “<strong>RKI</strong>”).
</p>
<p>
    The RKI is also what is called the controller under data protection law,
    meaning it is responsible for the processing of App users’ data.
</p>
<p>
    You can contact the RKI’s data protection officer at the above address
    (“FAO the data protection officer”) and by emailing: datenschutz@rki.de.
</p>
<h2>
    2. Is using the App voluntary?
</h2>
<p>
    Using the App is voluntary. It is therefore your decision alone whether you
    install the App and which features you use. Your data (such as information
    about your exposures and your risk of infection) will only be generated and
    stored on your own smartphone. Your data will only be shared with the RKI,
    your smartphone’s operating system or other users if you use one of the
    following App features and have consented to the necessary data transfer in
    the individual case:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Risk identification (see 6 a.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Registering a test (see 6 b.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Warning others (see 6 c.).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You are not obliged to use these features. If you decide not to grant the
    consent requested by one of these features, or if you subsequently withdraw
    your consent, you will not suffer any disadvantages. This will only mean
    that you cannot or can no longer use that consent-based feature of the App.
</p>
<p>
    The data processing performed in connection with these features is
    described in more detail in the following sections.
</p>
<h2>
    3. On what legal basis is your data processed?
</h2>
<p>
    In principle, the RKI will process your data only on the basis of your
    consent granted pursuant to Article 6(1) Sentence 1(a) and Article 9(2)(a)
    of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you have granted your
    consent, you can withdraw it at any time. Further information on your right
    of withdrawal and instructions on how to exercise this right can be found
    under 11.
</p>
<h2>
    4. Who is the App aimed at?
</h2>
<p>
    The App is aimed at people who are resident in Germany and at least 16
    years old.
</p>
<h2>
    5. What personal data is processed?
</h2>
<p>
    The App is designed to process as little personal data as possible. This
    means, for example, that the App does not collect any data that would allow
    the RKI or other users to infer your identity, health status or location.
    In addition, the App deliberately refrains from using tracking tools to
    record or analyse how you use the App.
</p>
<p>
    The data processed by the App can be grouped into the following categories:
</p>
<h3>
    a. Access data
</h3>
<p>
    Every time data is exchanged over the internet between the App and the
    App’s server system, the server system processes so-called access data.
    This is necessary for the App to retrieve current data from the server
    system or to transmit certain data stored on the smartphone to the server
    system. The following App features require this type of data exchange with
    the App’s server system:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Risk identification (retrieving the list of random IDs from users who
        have tested positive)
    </li>
    <li>
        Registering a test (transmitting the test code and retrieving the test
        result)
    </li>
    <li>
        Warning others (transmitting your random IDs).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This access data comprises the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        IP address
    </li>
    <li>
        Date and time of retrieval (time stamp)
    </li>
    <li>
        Transmitted data volume (or packet length)
    </li>
    <li>
        Notification of successful retrieval.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This access data is only processed to secure and maintain the technical
    infrastructure. You are not identified personally as a user of the App and
    it is not possible to create a user profile. The IP address will not be
    saved beyond the end of the period of use.
</p>
<p>
    In order to prevent unauthorised identification of your data by means of
    your IP address when you use the App, the App accesses the server system
    via a special access server. This access server then forwards the data
    requested or transmitted by the App to the appropriate server, but without
    your IP address, so that your IP address is no longer processed within the
    server system.
</p>
<h3>
    b. Exposure data
</h3>
<p>
    If you enable exposure logging in your smartphone’s operating system, then
    your smartphone will continuously send out randomly generated
    identification numbers (“<strong>random IDs</strong>”) via Bluetooth Low
    Energy, which other smartphones in your vicinity can receive if exposure
    logging is also enabled on them. Your smartphone, in turn, also receives
    the random IDs of the other smartphones. In addition to the random IDs
    received from other smartphones, your smartphone’s exposure logging
    functionality records the following exposure data:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Date and time of the contact
    </li>
    <li>
        Duration of the contact
    </li>
    <li>
        Bluetooth signal strength of the contact
    </li>
    <li>
        Encrypted metadata (protocol version and transmission strength).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Your own random IDs and those received from other smartphones as well as
    the other exposure data (date and time of the contact, duration of the
    contact, signal strength of the contact and encrypted metadata) are
    recorded by your smartphone’s exposure logging functionality and currently
    stored there for 14 days.
</p>
<p>
    The exposure logging functionality is called “COVID-19 Exposure
    Notifications” on Android smartphones and “Exposure Notification” on
    iPhones. Please note that this functionality is not part of the App, but an
    integral part of your operating system. The exposure logging functionality
    is therefore provided to you by Apple (iPhones) or Google (Android
    smartphones). Accordingly, any data processing performed by the operating
    system using this exposure logging functionality is subject to these
    companies’ respective privacy policies. The RKI is not responsible for this
    and has no influence on it.
</p>
<p>
    More information about the exposure logging functionality is available from
    the providers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Information from Google for Android smartphones:
        https://support.google.com/android/answer/9888358?hl=en
    </li>
    <li>
        Information from Apple for iPhones can be found on your smartphone under “Settings”
        &gt; "Exposure Notification“ and the link “How Exposure Notification
        works…”.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please note that the actual named us, operating steps, and settings options
    for the exposure logging functionality on your smartphone may differ from
    those described in this privacy notice depending on the version and
    configuration of your operating system.
</p>
<p>
    The App will only process the exposure data generated and stored by your
    operating system’s exposure logging functionality if the App’s risk
    identification feature is enabled.
</p>
<h3>
    c. Health data
</h3>
<p>
    Health data is any data containing information about the health of a
    particular individual. This includes not only information about past and
    current illnesses, but also about a person’s risk of illness (such as the
    risk that the person has been infected with the coronavirus).
</p>
<p>
    The App will process your health data if you use the following features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Risk identification, as soon as a potential exposure is detected (i.e.
        you may have been in contact with a person who has been infected with
        the coronavirus)
    </li>
    <li>
        Registering a test (test status and test result)
    </li>
    <li>
        Warning others (test result, and possibly information about symptoms
        and their onset).
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    6. App features
</h2>
<h3>
    a. Risk identification
</h3>
<p>
    The App’s core functionality is risk identification. This serves to track
    possible contacts with other users of the App who are infected with the
    coronavirus (possible exposures), to evaluate the risk that you yourself
    have been infected, and to provide you with health advice and
    recommendations for what to do next.
</p>
<p>
    If you enable the risk identification feature, then several times a day
    while the App runs in the background (or when you tap on “Update”), the App
    will retrieve a list from the App’s server system of random IDs, each with
    a transmission risk value (a numerical value from 1–8) from users who have
    tested positive and provided their own random IDs via the App using the
    feature for warning others. The transmission risk value is an estimate of
    the likelihood of infection on the day of the possible exposure in
    question. Since infectiousness (i.e. the risk of infection for those who
    come into contact with a person who has tested positive) is currently
    believed to depend on the duration and course of the infection, it can be
    taken into account, for example, that the more time has passed since the
    onset of symptoms, the lower the risk of infection on the day of a possible
    exposure.
</p>
<p>
    The App shares these random IDs with your smartphone’s exposure logging
    functionality, which then compares them with the random
    IDs logged by the exposure logging functionality. If your smartphone’s
    exposure logging functionality detects a match, it transfers the exposure
    data (date, duration, signal strength) to the App, but not the random ID of
    the contact in question.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a potential exposure, the App analyses the exposure data
    provided by the exposure logging functionality as well as the transmission
    risk value in order to determine your individual risk of infection.
</p>
<p>
    The evaluation algorithm which determines how the exposure data and the
    transmission risk value are interpreted (for example, how the duration of a
    contact influences the risk of infection) is based on current scientific
    findings. To account for new findings as and when they arise, the RKI can
    update the evaluation algorithm by adjusting its settings. The settings for
    the evaluation algorithm are sent to the App together with the list of
    random IDs of infected users.
</p>
<p>
    The identification of your risk of infection is only carried out locally on
    your smartphone, meaning that the data is processed offline without
    accessing the App’s server system. Once identified, the risk of infection
    is also only calculated in the App and is not passed on to any other
    recipients (including the RKI, Apple, Google and other third parties).
</p>
<p>
    The legal basis for the processing of your access data, exposure data and,
    if applicable, health data (if the App determines a possible exposure)
    described above is your consent which you gave when enabling the risk
    identification feature.
</p>
<h3>
    b. Registering a test
</h3>
<p>
    If you have been tested for the coronavirus, you can register the test in
    the App by scanning the QR code which you received from your doctor or the
    testing facility. The app will then inform you as soon as the test result
    is available from the laboratory.
</p>
<p>
    For this to work, the testing laboratory needs to be connected to the App’s
    server system and, as part of the testing procedure, you must have agreed
    separately to the laboratory transmitting your test result to the App’s
    server system (test result database). Test results from laboratories that
    are not connected to the App’s server system cannot be displayed in the
    App. If you have not received a QR code, the testing laboratory is not
    connected. In this case you will not be able to use this feature.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Registering a test</u>
</p>
<p>
    To receive the test result in the App, you must first register the test you
    have taken in the App. For this purpose, your doctor or the testing
    facility will provide you with a QR code when taking the sample. This QR
    code contains a code number which can be read with a QR code scanner. To
    register your test, you will need to scan the QR code in the App using your
    smartphone’s camera.
</p>
<p>
    The code number read from the QR code is then hashed by the App, which
    means that the App performs a certain mathematical procedure in order to
    convert the code number in such a way that it can no longer be recognised.
    As soon as your smartphone is connected to the internet, the App will
    transmit the hashed code number to the App’s server system. In return, the
    App receives a token from the server system, i.e. a digital access key that
    is stored in the App. The token is linked to the hashed code number on the
    server system. The App then deletes the hashed code number on your
    smartphone. The server system will only issue a token once for each hashed
    code number. This ensures that your QR code cannot be used by other users
    of the App to retrieve test results.
</p>
<p>
    This completes the registration of your test.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Filing of the test result</u>
</p>
<p>
    As soon as the testing laboratory receives the test result, it stores the
    result in the RKI’s test result database, indicating the hashed code
    number. The test result database is operated by the RKI on a special server
    within the App’s server system. Based on the code number contained in the
    QR code issued to you, the testing laboratory also generates the hashed
    code number using the same mathematical procedure as the App.<u></u>
</p>
<p>
    <u>Retrieval of the test result</u>
</p>
<p>
    Using the token, the App regularly requests the status of the registered
    test from the App’s server system. The server system then assigns the token
    to the hashed code number and transfers it to the test result database. If
    the test result has now been stored there, the test result database sends
    the test result back to the server system, which forwards it to the App
    without gaining any knowledge of the content.
</p>
<p>
    If the test result is positive, the App uses the token again to request a
    TAN (transaction number) from the server system. The server system
    reassigns the token to the hashed code number and requests confirmation
    from the test result database that a positive test result exists for the
    hashed code number. If the test result database confirms this, the server
    system generates the TAN and transmits it to the App. A copy of the TAN
    remains on the server system.
</p>
<p>
    The TAN is required to ensure that no false information is distributed to
    other users in the event of a positive test result being transmitted.
</p>
<p>
    The legal basis for the processing described above of the data mentioned
    above is your consent to using the test registration feature.
</p>
<h3>
    c. Warning others
</h3>
<p>
    If you use the feature for warning others, the App will transfer the random
    IDs (including the respective transmission risk values) generated and
    stored by your smartphone from the last 14 days and the TAN to the App’s
    server system. The server system first checks whether the TAN is valid and
    then adds your random IDs to the list of random IDs of users who have
    provided a positive test result. Your random IDs can now be downloaded by
    other users as part of the risk identification process.
</p>
<p>
    The information about symptoms and symptom onset requested by the feature
    for warning others is optional and not required to warn other users.
    However, this information can help to calculate more accurately the risk of
    infection to other users you have encountered. If you can’t or don’t want
    to answer some or all of the questions, just select “no answer”. In this
    case, the transmission risk values determined by the App and assigned to
    your random IDs will be based on the time that has passed since your test
    result was retrieved, assuming an average infection – meaning that the more
    time has passed since using a random ID, the lower its transmission risk
    value will be.
</p>
<p>
    <u>If you have not retrieved your test result in the App:</u>
</p>
<p>
    Even if you have not retrieved a positive test result in the App, you can
    share the test result via the App to warn other users. In this case, the
    App prompts you to enter a so-called TeleTAN, which acts as a TAN.
</p>
<p>
    To obtain a TeleTAN, please call the Corona-Warn-App hotline on +49 (0)800
    7540002. The operator will first ask you some questions over the phone to
    check the plausibility of your call. These questions serve to prevent
    fraudulent reports of infections and any resulting incorrect warnings and
    risk levels. Once you have answered these questions sufficiently, you will
    be asked for your mobile/telephone number. This is so that you can be
    called back later and given a TeleTAN to enter in the App. Your
    mobile/telephone number will only be temporarily stored for this purpose
    and deleted within one hour at the latest.
</p>
<p>
    After your call, the hotline employee will generate a TeleTAN via a special
    access to the App’s server system and then call you to tell you the
    TeleTAN. If you enter the TeleTAN in the App, the TeleTAN will be sent back
    from the App to the App’s server system for comparison and verification. In
    return, the App receives a token from the server system, i.e. a digital
    access key that is stored in the App. Using this token, the App then
    requests a TAN from the server system.
</p>
<p>
    The legal basis for this processing of your access data and health data
    (random IDs, test result, TAN and, if applicable, TeleTAN) is your consent
    to using the feature for warning others.
</p>
<h3>
    d. Using the App for information purposes only
</h3>
<p>
    As long as you use the App for information purposes only, i.e. do not use
    any of the App features mentioned above and do not enter any data, then
    processing only takes place locally on your smartphone and no personal data
    is generated. Depending on your operating system, websites linked in the
    App, such as www.bundesregierung.de, will
    open in your smartphone’s standard browser (Android smartphones) or within
    the App (iPhone). The data processed here depends on the data processing
    practices of the website you are visiting.
</p>
<h2>
    7. What permissions and functionality does the App require?
</h2>
<p>
    The App requires access to a number of your smartphone’s features and
    interfaces. For this purpose, you need to grant the App certain
    permissions. Permissions are programmed differently by different
    manufacturers. For example, individual permissions may be combined into
    permission categories, where you can only agree to the permission category
    as a whole. Please note that if the App is denied access, you will not be
    able to use any or all of the App’s features.
</p>
<h3>
    a. Technical requirements (all smartphones)

    <li>
        Background operation
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The App runs in the background (i.e. when you are not actively using the
    App) in order to be able to automatically identify your risk and query the
    status of a registered test. If you deny the App permission to run in the
    background in your smartphone’s operating system, then you must start all
    actions in the App itself.
</p>
<h3>
    b. Android smartphones
</h3>
<p>
    If you are using an Android smartphone, the following system features must also
    be enabled:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        COVID-19 Exposure Notifications
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The App’s risk identification feature requires this functionality.
    Otherwise, no exposure log with the random IDs of your contacts will be
    available. The functionality must be enabled within the App to allow the
    App to access the exposure log.

</p>
<h2>
    8. When will data be deleted?
</h2>
<p>
    All data stored in the App is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed for
    the App features:
</p>
<h3>
    a. Risk identification
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The list of random IDs of users who have shared a positive test result
        will be deleted from the App immediately, and also automatically
        deleted from your smartphone’s exposure log after 14 days.
    </li>
    <li>
        The RKI has no way of influencing the deletion of exposure data in the
        exposure log of your smartphone’s exposure logging functionality
        (including your own random IDs) and exposure data on other smartphones,
        as this functionality is provided by Apple or Google. In this case, the
        deletion depends on what Apple or Google has determined. Currently, the
        data is automatically deleted after 14 days. It may also be possible,
        using the functionality provided by Apple and Google, to manually
        delete data in your smartphone’s system settings.
    </li>
    <li>
        The risk of infection displayed in the App will be deleted as soon as a
        new risk level has been determined. A new risk level is usually
        determined after the App has received a new list of random IDs.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    b. Registering a test
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The hashed code number will be deleted from the App’s server system
        after 21 days.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the event of a negative test result, the hashed code number and the
        test result will be deleted from the test result database immediately
        after the test result is retrieved; and in the event of a positive test
        result, they will be deleted immediately after the copy of the TAN
        stored on the server system is deleted (see below).
    </li>
    <li>
        The token stored on the server system will be deleted after 21 days.
    </li>
    <li>
        The token stored in the App will be deleted from the smartphone after
        the App is deleted or after using the feature for warning others.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    c. Warning others
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Your smartphone’s own random IDs and transmission risk values which
        are provided via the App will be deleted from the server system after
        14 days.
    </li>
    <li>

<h2>
    9. Who will receive your data?
</h2>
<p>
    If you provide a test result by using the feature for warning other users,
    your random IDs and their transmission risk values from the last 14 days
    will be passed on to the App on other users’ smartphones.
</p>
<p>
    The RKI has commissioned Deutsche Telekom AG and SAP Deutschland SE &amp;
    Co. KG to operate and maintain part of the technical infrastructure of the
    App (e.g. server system, hotline), meaning that these two companies are
    processors under data protection law and acting on the RKI’s behalf
    (Article 28 GDPR).
</p>
<p>
    Otherwise, the RKI will only pass on personal data collected in connection
    with your use of the App to third parties if the RKI is legally obliged to
    do so or if this is necessary for legal action or criminal prosecution in
    the case of attacks on the App’s technical infrastructure. In other cases,
    personal data will not generally be passed on.
</p>
<h2>
    10. Is data transferred to a third country?
</h2>
<p>
    The data generated when the App is used is processed exclusively on servers
    in Germany or in another EU or EEA member state.
</p>
<h2>
    11. Withdrawal of consent
</h2>
<p>
    You have the right to withdraw any consent you granted the RKI in the App
    at any time with effect for the future. Please note that this will not
    affect the lawfulness of the processing before the withdrawal.
</p>
<p>
    To withdraw your consent to the risk identification feature, you can
    disable the feature using the toggle switch in the App or delete the App.
    If you decide to use the risk identification feature again, you can toggle
    the feature back on or reinstall the App.
</p>
<p>
    To withdraw your consent to the test registration feature, you can delete
    the test registration in the App. The token for retrieving the test result
    will then be deleted from your smartphone. Neither the RKI nor the testing
    laboratory can then assign the transmitted data to your App or smartphone.
    If you wish to register another test, you will be asked to grant your
    consent again.
</p>
<p>
    To withdraw your consent to the feature for warning others, you must delete
    the App. All of your random IDs stored in the App will then be removed and
    can no longer be assigned to your smartphone. If you wish to report another
    test result, you can reinstall the App and grant your consent again.
    Alternatively, you may be able to delete your own random IDs in the
    exposure logging functionality in your smartphone’s system settings. Please
    note that, once transmitted, the RKI has no way of deleting your random IDs
    and transmission risk values from the lists provided and from other users’
    smartphones.
</p>
<h2>
    12. Your other rights under data protection law
</h2>
<p>
    If the RKI processes your personal data, you also have the following data
    protection rights:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        the rights under Articles 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 and 21 GDPR,
    </li>
    <li>
        the right to contact the official RKI data protection officer
        (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Institut/OrgEinheiten/Datenschutz/Datenschutz_node.html)
        and raise your concerns (Article 38(4) GDPR) and
    </li>
    <li>
        the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection
        authority. To do so, you can either contact your local supervisory
        authority or the competent authority at the RKI’s headquarters. The
        competent supervisory authority for the RKI is the Federal Commissioner
        for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Graurheindorfer Straße
        153, 53117 Bonn.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please note that the RKI can only fulfil the rights mentioned above if the
    data on which your claim is based can be clearly assigned to you. This
    would only be possible if the RKI were to collect further personal data
    that would allow the data mentioned above to be clearly assigned to you or
    your smartphone. Since this is not necessary – and not intended – for the
    purposes of the App, the RKI is not obliged to collect such additional data
    (Article 11(2) GDPR). Moreover, this would run counter to the stated
    objective of keeping the amount of data processed for the App as low as
    possible. Against this backdrop, it will not normally be possible to
    directly fulfil the above data protection rights under Articles 15, 16, 17,
    18, 20 and 21 GDPR, as doing so would require additional information about
    you which is not available to the RKI.

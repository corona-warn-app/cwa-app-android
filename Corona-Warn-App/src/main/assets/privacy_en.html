</p>
<h1>
    1. Who is the Corona-Warn-App published by?
</h1>
<p>
    This app is published by the Robert Koch Institute (<strong>RKI</strong>)
    for the German Federal Government. The RKI is also responsible for ensuring
    that your data is processed in accordance with data protection regulations.
</p>
<p>
    If you have tested positive for coronavirus, you can use the transnational
    warning feature to also warn users of the official coronavirus apps of
    other countries whom you have encountered. In this case, the RKI and the
    competent health authorities of the countries participating in the
    transnational warning system are so-called joint controllers, meaning they
    are jointly responsible for data processing. Please refer to Section 7 for
    more details.
</p>
<h1>
    2. Is using the app voluntary?
</h1>
<p>
    Using the app is voluntary. It is entirely up to you whether you install
    the app, which of the app’s features you use, and whether you share data
    with others. All of the app’s features that require the transfer of your
    exposure or health data will obtain your express consent in advance. If you
    do not give your consent or if you subsequently withdraw it, this will not
    result in any disadvantages for you.
</p>
<h1>
    3. On what legal basis is your data processed?
</h1>
<p>
    Your data will only be processed if you have given your express consent
    beforehand. The legal basis is Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(a) GDPR and, in the
    case of health data, Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR. After giving your consent, you can
    withdraw it at any time (so-called right of withdrawal). Please refer to
    Section 12 for further information about your right of withdrawal. On the
    basis of Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(e) GDPR in conjunction with Sect. 3 of the
    German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), the processing of access data
    for the retrieval of daily statistics (see Section 6 d.) is performed as
    part of the RKI’s duty to inform the public pursuant to Sect. 4(4) of the
    Act on Successor Agencies to the Federal Health Agency (BGA-NachfG).
</p>
<h1>
    4. Who is the app aimed at?
</h1>
<p>
    The app is aimed at people who are resident in Germany and at least 16
    years old.
</p>
<h1>5. What data is processed?
</h1>
<p>
    The app’s entire system has been programmed to process as little personal
    data as possible. This means that the system does not collect any data that
    would allow the RKI or other users to infer your identity, your name, your
    location or other personal details. The app does not therefore use any
    analysis tools to evaluate the way you use it.
</p>
<p>
    The data processed by the app can be grouped into the following categories:
</p>
<h2>
    a. Access data
</h2>
<p>
    Every time the app exchanges data over the internet with the RKI’s server
    system (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>server system</strong>), the
    server system processes so-called access data. This is necessary so that
    the app can retrieve current data (e.g. for warnings) or transmit certain
    data stored on your smartphone to the server system. This access data
    includes the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        IP address
    </li>
    <li>
        Date and time of retrieval
    </li>
    <li>
        Transmitted data volume (or packet length)
    </li>
    <li>
        Notification of whether the data exchange was a success.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This access data is processed to maintain and secure the technical
    operation of the app and the server system. You will not be identified
    personally as a user of the app and no user profile will be created. Your
    IP address will not be stored beyond the end of the usage procedure.
</p>
<p>
    In order to prevent unauthorised parties from using your IP address to
    associate your data with you when you use the app, the app only ever
    accesses the server system via a special access server. This access server
    then forwards the data requested or transmitted by the app to the
    appropriate server, but without your IP address, meaning that your IP
    address is no longer processed within the server system.
</p>
<h2>
    b. Exposure data
</h2>
<p>
    As soon as you enable your iPhone’s or your Android smartphone’s COVID-19
    exposure notification system (which is called “Exposure Notifications” or
    “COVID-19 Exposure Notifications” respectively), your smartphone transmits
    so-called exposure data via Bluetooth, which other smartphones in your
    vicinity can record. Your smartphone, in turn, also receives the exposure
    data of other smartphones. The exposure data transmitted by your smartphone
    comprises:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Random identification numbers (hereinafter referred to as <strong>random IDs</strong>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Bluetooth protocol version
    </li>
    <li>
        Bluetooth transmit power in decibel-milliwatts (dBm).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If exposure to another smartphone is recorded, the exposure data also
    includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Day, time and duration of the contact
    </li>
    <li>
        Bluetooth signal strength in dBm.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The random IDs are changed regularly. This helps prevent your smartphone
    from being identified using these random IDs. The exposure data transmitted
    by your smartphone and the exposure data recorded when you come into
    contact with other app users are stored on your smartphone and deleted
    after 14 days. The exposure data transmitted by your smartphone is
    processed in the same way when it is recorded by the smartphones of other
    app users.
</p>
<p>
    Please note: the COVID-19 exposure notification system functionality is
    part of your operating system. The providers responsible for this system
    are therefore Apple (if you have an iPhone) and Google (if you have an
    Android smartphone). In this respect, the data processing is subject to
    these companies’ own privacy policies, which means that the RKI is not
    responsible for this and has no influence on it. Depending on the version
    and configuration of your operating system, the actual names, operating
    steps and settings options may differ from those described in this privacy
    notice. More information is available from the respective providers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you have an Android smartphone, you can find information from Google
        on your device by going to “Settings” &gt; “Google” &gt; “COVID-19
        exposure notifications” and tapping on “Learn more”.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have an iPhone, you can find information from Apple on your
        device by going to “Settings” &gt; “Exposure Notifications” and tapping
        on “How Exposure Notifications work ...”.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    c. Health data
</h2>
<p>
    Health data is any data containing information about a person’s health.
    This includes not only information about past and current illnesses, but
    also about a person’s risk of illness (such as the risk that a person has
    been infected with coronavirus). The app processes health data in the
    following cases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        When a possible exposure is identified
    </li>
    <li>
        If you use the app to retrieve a test result
    </li>
    <li>
        If you use the app to warn other users that they may be infected
    </li>
    <li>
        If you provide information about the onset of any coronavirus symptoms.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Section 6 explains this in more detail.
</p>
<h1>
    6. Why is your data processed?
</h1>
<h2>
    a. Exposure logging
</h2>
<p>
    Exposure logging is part of the app’s main functionality. It serves to warn
    you of possible exposure to people who have tested positive for coronavirus
    (“possible exposures”) in a number of different countries, to assess the
    risk that you have been infected as a result of the exposure, and to
    provide you with health advice and recommendations for what to do next.
</p>
<p>
    For this purpose, the app retrieves an up-to-date list from the server
    system several times a day. This list contains the random IDs, along with
    any voluntary symptom information, of users who have tested positive for
    coronavirus and used the warning feature in their app, which is the
    official coronavirus app in any country participating in the transnational
    warning system (see Section 7) (hereinafter referred to as a <strong>positive list</strong>).
    The random IDs on the positive list also
    contain a transmission risk value and an indication of the type of
    diagnosis (see Section 6 c.).
</p>
<p>
    The app passes the random IDs from the positive list to the COVID-19
    exposure notification system, which compares them with the random IDs it
    has recorded from your encounters with other users. If the COVID-19
    exposure notification system detects a match, it transfers to the app the
    exposure data recorded for the possible exposure in question. The app
    evaluates this exposure data as well as the information on the positive
    list (transmission risk value; information about the onset of symptoms) in
    order to determine your risk of infection. The rules for evaluating this
    information (for example, how the duration of a contact influences the risk
    of infection) are based on the RKI’s latest scientific findings. In the
    event of new findings, the RKI can update the evaluation rules by adjusting
    the evaluation settings in the app. In this case, the new evaluation
    settings are sent to the app together with the positive list.
</p>
<p>
    The risk of infection is calculated exclusively offline in the app and is
    not passed on to the COVID-19 exposure notification system or any other
    recipient (including the RKI, other health authorities in Germany or other
    countries, Apple, Google and other third parties).
</p>
<h2>
    b. Retrieving a test result
</h2>
<p>
    If you have taken a coronavirus test, you can retrieve your test result via
    the app. The app will notify you as soon as your test result is available.
    For this to work, the testing laboratory needs to be connected to the
    server system and, as part of the testing procedure, you must have given
    separate consent to your test result being sent. It is not possible to
    display test results from laboratories that are not connected to the server
    system. If you have not received a QR code, then you cannot use this
    feature either.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Scanning the QR code</u>
</p>
<p>
    In order to retrieve your test result via the app, you will need to scan
    the QR code using your smartphone’s camera. The QR code contains a code
    number that is read during scanning and is assigned to your test. After
    reading the code number, the app ‘hashes’ it. This means that the app
    performs a certain mathematical procedure in order to convert the code
    number in such a way that it can no longer be identified. However, it is
    still possible to clearly assign the hashed code number to your test
    result. As soon as your smartphone is connected to the internet, the app
    will transmit the hashed code number to the server system. The server
    system then provides a digital access key (a so-called token), which is
    stored in the app. The token is linked to the hashed code number in the
    server system. The app now deletes the code number that has been hashed on
    your smartphone and keeps only the token. Once the QR code has been used in
    this way, it becomes invalid and can no longer be used by anyone. This
    ensures that no other users can use your QR code to retrieve your test
    result.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Filing of the test result</u>
</p>
<p>
    As soon as your test result is available, the laboratory stores it in the
    RKI’s test result database using only the hashed code number. The test
    result database is located on a special server within the server system.
    The laboratory generates the hashed code number based on the same QR code
    that you received.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Retrieval of the test result</u>
</p>
<p>
    Using the token stored in the app, the app regularly requests the status of
    your test from the server system. The server system then informs the app of
    the current status (result not yet available / result available). As soon
    as your test result is available, the outcome (i.e. whether you have tested
    positive or negative for coronavirus) is also transmitted to the app. If
    you have enabled the test status notification (under “Settings” &gt;
    “Notifications”), you will be notified. The test result will not be
    displayed until you open the app.
</p>
<p>
    If you have tested positive for coronavirus, the app uses the token again
    to request a TAN (transaction number) from the server system. The TAN is
    required to ensure that no false warnings are transmitted to other users.
    For this purpose, the server system reassigns the token to the hashed code
    number and requests confirmation from the test result database that a
    positive test result really does exist for the hashed code number. If this
    is confirmed, the server system generates the TAN and transmits it to the
    app. A copy of the TAN remains on the server system.
</p>
<h2>
    c. Warning others
</h2>
<p>
    If you have tested positive for coronavirus and share your random IDs with
    the app, then it is possible to warn other app users whom you have
    encountered. This applies to other users of the Corona-Warn-App as well as
    users of any other official coronavirus app in participating countries. In
    this case, the app transmits the following data to the server system:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Your own random IDs from the last 14 days
    </li>
    <li>
        Any information about the onset of symptoms
    </li>
    <li>
        Your TAN (see Section 6 b.).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Before passing on your test result (more precisely: before transmitting
    your random IDs) to the server system, the app adds a transmission risk
    value to the data and also specifies the type of test performed. Since the
    app’s warning feature can only be used for lab-confirmed test results, the
    type of test is the same for all users. The transmission risk value is an
    estimate of how infectious you were on each day of the 14-day period. Since
    how infectious a person is or was depends on the duration and course of the
    infection, it can be taken into account, for example, that the more time
    has passed since the onset of symptoms, the lower the risk of a person
    spreading the virus on the day of a possible exposure. These additional
    transmission risk values allow a more precise determination of the
    likelihood that you have infected other users.
</p>
<p>
    The information requested by the app about the onset of symptoms is
    optional. However, this information may help to calculate the transmission
    risk value even more accurately. If you do not provide information about
    your symptoms, then the transmission risk values will be calculated
    assuming a typical case of infection with coronavirus, i.e. the more time
    has passed since a random ID was used, the lower the associated
    transmission risk value.
</p>
<p>
    <u>If you have not retrieved your test result in the app:</u>
</p>
<p>
    Even if you have not retrieved your positive test result via the app, you
    can still warn fellow users. To do this, select the “Request TAN”
    procedure. The app will then prompt you to call the app hotline. A hotline
    worker will then ask you a few questions to make sure that you really have
    tested positive for coronavirus. This is to prevent false warnings being
    transmitted, either by accident or intentionally. Once you have answered
    these questions sufficiently, you will be asked for your mobile/telephone
    number and your name. This is so that you can be called back later and
    given what’s called a TeleTAN to enter in the app. Your mobile/telephone
    number and your name will be temporarily stored for this purpose only and
    deleted after an hour at the latest. Immediately after your call, the
    hotline worker will generate a unique TeleTAN via a special access to the
    server system and then call you back to tell you this TeleTAN. A TeleTAN is
    only valid for one hour and will therefore be deleted no later than one
    hour after it has been passed on to you. After a valid TeleTAN is entered
    in the app, it is transmitted to the server system. The TeleTAN thus makes
    it possible to check that a positive test result really does exist and thus
    prevent false alarms. The app then receives a token from the server system,
    as it does after a valid QR code is scanned (see “Retrieving a test result”
    in Section 6 b. above).
</p>
<h2>
    d. Using the app for information purposes only
</h2>
<p>
    The app automatically receives the daily statistics that appear in the app
    via the server system. This generates access data. Websites linked in the
    app, such as <u>www.bundesregierung.de</u>, are opened and displayed in
    your standard browser (Android smartphones) or within the app (iPhones).
    Which data is processed in this context depends on the respective providers
    of the websites accessed.
</p>
<h1>
    7. How does the transnational warning system work?
</h1>
<p>
    To ensure that users are also warned by the official coronavirus apps of
    other countries, the RKI, together with several official healthcare bodies
    and authorities in other countries (hereinafter referred to as <strong>health
    authorities</strong>) has set up a central warning server
    for sharing warnings between countries (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>exchange
    server</strong>). The exchange server uses the digital
    infrastructure of the eHealth Network established between the Member
    States.
</p>
<p>
    The national server systems of the coronavirus apps connected to the
    exchange server regularly transmit their own positive lists to the exchange
    server and receive the positive lists of the other countries.
</p>
<p>
    The server system merges the positive lists received in this way with its
    own positive list, which allows the exposure logging feature to also take
    into account possible exposures involving users of another coronavirus app
    (see point 6 c.) The other participating countries proceed in the same way
    with the positive lists provided by the RKI.
</p>
<p>
    Only countries whose coronavirus apps are compatible with each other and
    which guarantee a comparably high level of data protection can participate
    in the joint exchange server. In particular, this requires that the
    coronavirus apps of the participating countries also use the COVID-19
    exposure notification system, are approved by the respective national
    health authorities, and respect the privacy of their users. The technical
    and organisational details of this cooperation are laid down in an EU
    Commission Decision (Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/1023 of 15
    July 2020, which is available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2020/1023/oj).
</p>
<p>
    Together with the respective competent health authorities of the
    participating countries, the RKI is a joint controller under data
    protection law, meaning it is responsible for processing the information
    contained on the positive lists (random IDs and, if applicable, information
    about the onset of symptoms) on the exchange server in order to enable the
    transnational exposure logging and warning system.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the list of participating countries is subject to change.
    The current list, with details of the competent health authorities in each
    case, can be found in the FAQs available at
    https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/#interoperability_countries .
</p>
<h1>8. What permissions does the app require?
</h1>
<p>
    The app requires access to a number of your smartphone’s features and
    interfaces. For this purpose, you need to grant the app certain
    permissions. The permission system depends on your operating system’s
    specifications. For example, your smartphone may combine individual
    permissions into permission categories, where you can only agree to the
    permission category as a whole. Please note that without the permissions
    requested by the app, you will not be able to use some or all of the app
    features.
</p>
<h2>
    a. Technical requirements (all smartphones)
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The app requires an internet connection in order to exchange data with
        the server system.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Bluetooth feature must be enabled so that your smartphone can
        transmit its own random IDs and record the random IDs of other
        smartphones.
    </li>
    <li>
        The app needs to be able to run in the background on your smartphone in
        order to automatically identify your risk of infection and check the
        status of your test. If you deny the app permission to run in the
        background, then you must start all actions in the app itself.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    b. Android smartphones
</h2>
<p>
    If you are using an Android smartphone, the following system features must
    also be enabled:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Android COVID-19 exposure notification system (COVID-19 Exposure
        Notifications)
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have a smartphone running on Android version 10 or lower,
        location services need to be enabled for your smartphone to search for
        Bluetooth signals from other smartphones. Please note that no location
        data is collected in this process.
    </li>
    <li>
        The notification feature must be enabled so that you can be notified of
        changes to your risk of infection and the status of test results. The
        notification feature is enabled by default in the operating system.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The app also requires the following permissions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The feature for retrieving a test result requires access to the camera
        in order to scan the QR code.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    c. iPhones (Apple iOS)
</h2>
<p>
    If you are using an iPhone, the following system features must be enabled:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The iOS COVID-19 exposure notification system (Exposure Notifications)
    </li>
    <li>
        Notifications must be enabled so that you can be notified of changes to
        your risk of infection and the status of your test.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The app also requires the following permissions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The feature for retrieving a test result requires access to the camera
        in order to scan the QR code.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>9. When will your data be deleted?
</h1>
<p>
    The storage period depends on the purposes or app features for which your
    data has been stored. When determining the storage period, the RKI takes
    into account the latest scientific findings on the incubation period (i.e.
    the period between exposure to infection and the appearance of the first
    symptoms, which is up to 14 days) as well as on how long there is a risk of
    an infected person infecting someone else after the end of the incubation
    period. Unless otherwise specified under Section 6, the following storage
    periods apply:
</p>
<h2>
    a. Data on your smartphone
</h2>
<p>
    The positive lists are deleted from the app memory after 14 days. The
    infection risk determined for you (e.g. “low risk”) is deleted from the app
    memory after each update, but after 14 days at the latest. If you have
    retrieved a positive test result, the token in the app memory is deleted as
    soon as you activate the warning feature.
</p>
<h2>
    b. Data on server systems
</h2>
<p>
    Positive lists are deleted from all server systems (including the exchange
    server) after 14 days. All other data will be deleted after 21 days at the
    latest.
</p>
<h1>
    10. Who will receive your data?
</h1>
<p>
    If you warn other users via the app, your test result (in the form of your
    random IDs from the last 14 days) as well as optional information you
    provide about the onset of your symptoms will be forwarded to the competent
    health authorities of each of the countries participating in the exchange
    server. From there, they will be passed on to the server systems of the
    coronavirus apps of those countries participating in the transnational
    warning system. The server systems of the national coronavirus apps then
    distribute this information to their own users as part of the positive
    lists.
</p>
<p>
    The competent national health authorities in the participating countries
    have commissioned the EU Commission, as data processor, to operate and
    maintain the joint warning system.
</p>
<p>
    The RKI has commissioned T-Systems International GmbH and SAP Deutschland
    SE &amp; Co. KG to operate and maintain part of the technical
    infrastructure of the app (e.g. server system, hotline), meaning that these
    two companies are processors under data protection law and acting on the
    RKI’s behalf. The EU Commission has also commissioned these companies, as
    sub-processors, with the technical provision and management of the
    participating countries’ joint warning system.
</p>
<p>
    Otherwise, the RKI will only pass on your data collected in connection with
    your use of the app to third parties if the RKI is legally obliged to do so
    or if this is necessary for legal action or criminal prosecution in the
    case of attacks on the app’s technical infrastructure. In other cases,
    personal data will not generally be passed on.
</p>
<h1>
    11. Is your data transferred to countries outside the EU?
</h1>
<p>
    If you activate the warning feature, please note that users can retrieve
    the latest positive lists regardless of where they are (even if they are
    abroad on holiday or on a business trip, for example). Otherwise, the data
    transmitted by the app is processed exclusively on servers in Germany or in
    another country in the EU (or the European Economic Area), which are
    therefore subject to the strict requirements of the General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR).
</p>
<h1>
    12. How can you withdraw your consent?
</h1>
<p>
    You have the right to withdraw any consent you granted the RKI in the app
    at any time with effect for the future. Please note, however, that any
    processing of your data that has already been carried out cannot be
    reversed. In particular, once your random IDs have been transmitted, the
    RKI has no way of deleting these from other users’ smartphones.
</p>
<h2>
    a. Consent to “exposure logging”
</h2>
<p>
    You can withdraw your consent to the app’s exposure logging feature at any
    time by disabling the feature in the app’s settings or by deleting the app.
    If you would like to use the exposure logging feature again, you can
    re-enable the feature or reinstall the app.
</p>
<h2>
    b. Consent to “retrieving a test result”
</h2>
<p>
    You can withdraw your consent to the test result retrieval feature by
    displaying the test in the app and then deleting it. The token for
    retrieving the test result will consequently be deleted from the app
    memory, so that the token can no longer be assigned on the server system.
    It is not possible to assign the same test to your app again or to scan the
    same QR code again. If you have been tested again and wish to retrieve the
    test result, you will be asked for your consent again. If the test result
    is already available in the app, then you can no longer withdraw your
    consent.
</p>
<h2>
    c. Consent to “warning others”
</h2>
<p>
    If you would like to withdraw your consent to the transmission of your test
    result (or, more precisely, your consent to the transmission of your random
    IDs from recent days) for warning other people, you can display the test
    and then deactivate “Warn others”. This option is available as long as you
    have not yet transmitted your random IDs to warn other users.
</p>
<p>
    After you have transmitted your random IDs, you can only withdraw your
    consent by deleting the app. Your random IDs already transmitted to the
    server system will consequently be deleted from the app memory and can no
    longer be assigned to you personally or your smartphone. If you wish to
    activate the warning feature again, you will need to reinstall the app and
    give your consent again. Once a test result has been assigned to your app
    and transmitted in order to warn others, it cannot be used again to warn
    others.
</p>
<p>
    Once your random IDs and transmission risk values have been transmitted,
    the RKI has no way of deleting them from the positive lists distributed by
    the server system or from users’ smartphones. If you also wish to delete
    your exposure data stored in your smartphone’s COVID-19 exposure
    notification system, you may be able to manually delete it in your
    smartphone’s system settings. Please also note the information in Section 5
    b.
</p>
<h1>
    13. What other rights do you have under data protection law?
</h1>
<p>
    If the RKI processes your personal data, you also have the following data
    protection rights:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The rights under Art. 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 and 21 GDPR,
    </li>
    <li>
        the right to contact the official
        RKI data protection officer
        (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Institut/OrgEinheiten/Datenschutz/Datenschutz_node.html)
        and raise your concerns (Art. 38(4) GDPR) and
    </li>
    <li>
        the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory
        authority. To do so, you can either contact your local supervisory
        authority or the authority responsible for the RKI. The supervisory
        authority responsible for the RKI is the Federal Commissioner for Data
        Protection and Freedom of Information, Graurheindorfer Straße 153,
        53117 Bonn.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You also have these data protection rights vis-à-vis the health authorities
    responsible for data processing in the countries participating in the
    exchange server, insofar as you have transmitted your random IDs from
    recent days to warn other people (see Section 7).
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the rights mentioned above can only be fulfilled if the
    data on which your claim is based can be clearly assigned to you. This
    would only be possible if the app were used to collect further personal
    data that would allow the data transmitted to the server system to be
    clearly assigned to you or your smartphone. Since this is not necessary for
    the purposes of the app, the RKI is not obliged to collect such additional
    data (Art. 11(2) GDPR). Moreover, this would run counter to the stated
    objective of collecting as little data as possible. For this reason, it
    will generally not be possible to fulfil the above data protection rights
    even if you provide additional information about your identity.
</p>
<h1>
    14. Data protection officer and contact
</h1>
<p>
    If you have any questions or concerns regarding data protection, you are
    welcome to send them to the RKI’s official data protection officer by post
    to Robert Koch-Institut, FAO the data protection officer, Nordufer 20,
    13353 Berlin, or by emailing datenschutz@rki.de.

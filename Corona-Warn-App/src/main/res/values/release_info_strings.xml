        <item>"The rules for certificates (with regard to their validity, for example, or their prioritization when several certificates are available) and for determining your “G” status (vaccinated, recovered, tested) have been separated from the Corona-Warn-App. These rules are now stored centrally and can therefore be adjusted independently of app releases, which will make it possible to react to rule changes more quickly. After a change, the updated rules will be transferred to the app automatically. This central administration of rules does not change how you use the Corona-Warn-App."</item>

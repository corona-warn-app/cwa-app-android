    <string name="settings_tracing_body_text">"You need to enable the exposure logging feature so that the app can determine whether you are at risk of infection. The exposure logging feature works transnationally, meaning any possible exposure involving users is also detected by other official coronavirus apps.\n\nThe exposure logging feature works by your Android smartphone receiving encrypted random IDs from other app users via Bluetooth and passing your own random IDs to their smartphones. Every day, the app downloads lists containing the random IDs – along with any voluntary information about the onset of symptoms – of all users who have tested positive for the virus and voluntarily shared this information (specifically: their random IDs) via their app. This list is then compared with the random IDs of other users you have encountered that have been recorded by your Android smartphone, in order to calculate the likelihood that you have also been infected and to warn you if necessary.\n\nYou can use the toggle switch to disable exposure logging at any time.\n\nPersonal data, such as your name, address, or location, is never recorded during exposure logging, nor is this information passed on to other users. It is not possible to use random IDs to draw conclusions about individual persons."</string>

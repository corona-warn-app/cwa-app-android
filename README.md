The goal of this project is to develop the official Corona-Warn-App for Germany based on the exposure notification API from [Apple](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/). The apps (for both iOS and Android) use Bluetooth technology to exchange anonymous encrypted data with other mobile phones (on which the app is also installed) in the vicinity of an app user's phone. The data is stored locally on each user's device, preventing authorities or other parties from accessing or controlling the data. This repository contains the **native Android implementation** of the Corona-Warn-App.

## Development

* [Home](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/wiki)
* [1 Setup](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/wiki/1-Setup)
* [2 Backend](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/wiki/2-Backend)
* [3 UI](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/wiki/3-UI)
* [4 Exposure Notification Google API](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/wiki/4-Google-Exposure-Notifications-API)
* [5 Packages](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/wiki/5-Packages)

## Known Issues

* The Exposure Notification API is going to block you from successfully testing the Application unless you are whitelisted inside GMS; **Shoutout to @pocmo for working on a demo mode to test unreleased app versions in advance without whitelisting (issue [#321](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/issues/321))**, if you want to contribute you can reach out [here](https://github.com/pocmo/cwa-app-android) for the time being - thank you!
* The Storage is currently based on Encrypted Shared Preferences and SQL Cipher (SQLite) - this could change in the future
* Test Coverage is generally low and needs to be improved. We appreciate your help here!
* In General every TODO comment within the code or the documentation can be regarded as an issue. You are free to tackle the TODOs anytime!
* We are aware of the Play Store Limitations of GMS.
* Without your own server instance (e.g. a local Docker setup), you will not be able to test the Application. For help, please refer to the [server implementation](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-server).
* Strings including translations are handled separately, for suggestions / findings please have a look at issue #332

## Architecture & Documentation

The full documentation for the Corona-Warn-App is in the [cwa-documentation](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation) repository. The documentation repository contains technical documents, architecture information, UI/UX specifications, and whitepapers related to this implementation.

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times.

## Contributors

The German government has asked SAP and Deutsche Telekom to develop the Corona-Warn-App for Germany as open source software. Deutsche Telekom is providing the network and mobile technology and will operate and run the backend for the app in a safe, scalable and stable manner. SAP is responsible for the app development, its framework and the underlying platform. Therefore, development teams of SAP and Deutsche Telekom are contributing to this project. At the same time our commitment to open source means that we are enabling -in fact encouraging- all interested parties to contribute and become part of its developer community.
